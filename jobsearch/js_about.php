<h1>Job Search Application</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This application keeps track of a person's job history, references, 
educational history, and skillset. I wrote it to demonstrate a LAMP 
application built with an MVC architecture.</p>
<p>I developed the application on an EeePC running a version of Debian linux, 
an Apache 2 webserver, a MySQL database server, and PHP 5. The code was 
written using the ee linux editor.</p>
<h2>Model-View-Controller</h2>
<h3>the model</h3>
<p>The model is a MySQL relational database consisting of two tables so far: jobs, 
and organizations. The plan for the database includes three additional tables: 
persons, education, and skills. Each table has a unique primary key. All data can 
be referenced using either the primary key or a foreign key.</p>
<h3>the view</h3>
<p>The view consists of xhtml compliant markup and stylesheets. To increase 
accessibility for text-based browsers and reader applications for the blind, tables 
are not used for the layout. For such browsers, the webpages remain usable and 
logical.</p>
<p>To increase legibility for the near-sighted, all dimensions are given in ems 
rather than pixels or other units. This ensures that all proportions remain correct 
if the user has a larger default character size set, or increases (or decreases) 
the character size.</p>
<p>To provide maximum compatibility for differing monitor sizes, the width of the 
browser page is set to 40ems. This provides a readable width for the screen while 
still fitting on most monitors without horizontal scrolling.</p>
<p>The plan calls for additional stylesheets for printing and for mobile 
devices.</p>
<h3>the controller</h3>
<p>I use PHP utitlities files to access and manipulate the database tables. A table 
object class is set up for each table, consisting of an element for each field in 
the corresponding table, and three methods corresponding to three types of SQL 
queries.</p>
<p><a href="js_code.php">View the php code</a></p>
<h3>table object methods</h3>
<ul>
        <li>select: send a select query to get the values for all the fields for 
a given primary key value. Set the values of the object elements to the 
corresponding values of the result set from the query. Return a table object.</li>
        <li>insert: send an insert query to insert a new row in the table, setting 
the field values to the values of the table object elements. Return the value of 
the primary key for the new record that was inserted.</li>
        <li>update: send an update query to change the values of the fields for a 
given primary key value of the table. Change the field values to the corresponding 
values of the elements of the table object. Return '0' if successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The php files that create the markup pages feed information about the table data 
into the markup as well as the data itself. The table name may be passed as a css 
class for a div, p or other tag. The field name may also be passed as another css 
class. And especially for input fields on forms, the value of the primary key for 
the data element may be passed as a css id. In addition, the data item may also be 
tagged with a css class identifying it as a fieldname or a fieldvalue.</p>
<p>List page example: each row from the database jobs table is wrapped in paragraph 
tags set to a class of "job_row" and an id of the value of the primary key for that 
row. Each field from that row is wrapped in a span tag set to a class named for the 
fieldname. This allows the actual sequence of the field values and the width of 
each column to be set separately using stylesheets.</p>
<p>Information page example: this page displays field information for a single 
record from the jobs table, and provides the options of inserting a new job, 
updating an existing job, or simply viewing the information for a job. In the 
markup, the each field's values are provided in two formats: a span tag set to a 
class of "fieldvalue" and an id set to the field's name; and an input field tag. 
The body tag id's name is based on the type of form desired for a given object 
method.</p>
<h3>body tag ids</h3>
<ul>
        <li>add: an empty form that will use an insert method</li>
        <li>modify: a prefilled form that will use an update method</li>
        <li>view: a text-only page with no form input at all.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Based on the body tag id, The style sheet can then determine whether the 
fieldvalue class and the input tags should be shown or not based on the body tag 
id. Again, the exact placement of the data on the page and what fields should be 
shown or not can all be set from the stylesheet.</p>
