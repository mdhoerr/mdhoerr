            <p><font color="#000000" size="-1">On September 16, 1998,
            the Myers-Briggs™ Personality Type on the Web hit
            the web. I had been practicing with other personal sites
            before, and this time I wanted to put up something that
            would attract some traffic. I patterned the format after
            The Mining Company guide sites (now about.com). If you
            take a look at about.com, you can see that my site has
            diverged somewhat, but is still based on the idea of
            providing a "guide" to web
            sites.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

            get about 100 unique visitors a day, most of whom find me
            in the search engines, when they search for Myers-Briggs.
            About 10 - 20% of you, however, appear to be regulars.
            Most of you identify yourselves to me as N, but there is
            a sizable chunk of visitors that prefer
            S.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

            basic concept has not changed. I provide four or five
            reviewed links every week, including one specifically
            relating to one of the sixteen types - my Focus on Type
            review. I also provide one original article every week,
            usually by me, but sometimes I get someone else to do it.
            Any more volunteers out there?&nbsp;<br>
            <img src="1999Q3archive_files/dot_clear.gif" alt="indent" align="bottom" height="1" hspace="10" width="1">The
            big changes have been in the ways I've tried to get
            feedback. I've gone from the usual guest book idea to
            specific feedback questions in several places. Often, the
            sites I review, or the articles I write are based on
            something you have sent me. A big surprise was how
            popular the "Recommend a Book" form was. And yes, I'm
            hoping to get them back to working soon! I miss your
            feedback.&nbsp;<br>

            change has been the addition of the Amazon associate
            links. A moderate money-maker, it still doesn't even pay
            my ISP fees. So look for me to add other associate
            programs. I need to find a way to make this site pay for
            the time and money I invest in it. Any suggestions are
            appreciated.&nbsp;<br>

            articles from the Bulletin of Psychological Type, there
            is little information available online. One of the

            This includes ISTP, ISTJ, INTP and INTJ, and he puts ISTP

            <p><font size="-1">On the other hand, I always thought of

            a life story. These events would be crisis points where

            problem is solved, and the character changes, grows,
            learns from past mistakes, gains understanding and
            transformation, and finally achieves wisdom that is
            shared. The significant events would be universal. We all
            go through them, but they touch individuals in different
            ways at different times at nearly the same stages in
            life, although some are late or early bloomers.

            a 90-page script, the significant events will be scaled
            back thirty pages because the script ends sooner. In a
            120-page screenplay, Act III begins on page 90. The
            resolution of the conflict and quick ending appears by
            page 120, leaving pages 90 to 120 to work on the
            outcome.&nbsp;<br>

            Divide the story into six parts, or chapters, separated
            by the five major turning points in the story.&nbsp;<br>
            <b>Write the premise.</b>&nbsp;<br>
            Make the first chapter (which is an expanded hook) into
            the premise. The protagonist, the hero, heroine, or best
            character will be introduced by name and MBTI type in the
            first act. Then work in the protagonist's allies and
            mention their MBTI type and temperament. In the second
            scene of the first act, develop an important point about
            the antagonist and his allies revealing each person's
            type and how an important point related to
            type.&nbsp;<br>

            did the character use his or her type to solve a
            problem?&nbsp;<br>
            <b>Pinpoint the significant events.</b>&nbsp;<br>
            From these main parts of the story, lay out the twelve
            most important events. These can be pinned up on a cork
            bulletin board or highlighted with a marker. At each

                     increase to the breaking point. This would be an

            sense, that I find it very difficult to separate out the
            functions I usually see other people use from what their

            me and greets me in the morning, they are using the F
            function. So I shut down the analysis for the moment,

                     world. Same with the French, the Japanese, any
                     strong culture. We observe a common, even
                     stereotypical, set of attributes and say, "Ah,
                     (he or she) is American." Or French. Or
                     Japanese.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

                     beneath these broad categories we discover more
                     divisions. What state is this American from
                     (What Department is this French person from?)
                     What city? Is this person urban or rural?
                     Educated or illiterate? Young or old? Artistic
                     or practical? Therefore, while it is enjoyable
                     and even useful to class people by personality
                     type, any deeper look opens even more questions
                     and doors. Fundamentally we are
                     individual.</font></p>

            <i>by Mary Hoerr, August 9, 1999</i>&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">While surfing the web looking for
            links and information on type, I came across someone who
            described how his boss used type. The boss would give him
            something to do, and say he would like it because "his
            type likes that kind of thing." When the employee said he
            didn't really, the boss would say the employee just
            didn't really understand type, and insisted he would like
            the task. The boss and employee were of different
            types.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">I could think of three reasons, just
            to start out, why the boss could have been wrong about
            the task. First of all, maybe the boss didn't know enough
            about his employee's type to know what that type
            preferred. He was getting feedback from the horse's
            mouth, and not listening.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Secondly, maybe the employee had been
            mistyped - several sources I've read place the percentage
            of people that are assigned the wrong type by the
            MBTI® instrument at 25%. And the percentage is
            probably even higher among those who just take an
            MB-based indicator (like the Keirsey sorter) without any
            professional interpretation or counselling on the
            results.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Finally, maybe some factor unrelated
            to type is at work here. For example, just because an
            ENTP tends to be a nonconformist who questions authority,
            it does not mean that this particular ENTP won't be a
            strictly practicing member of her religious group -
            whether a Roman Catholic who fasts on Ash Wednesday or an
            Orthodox Jew who won't eat pork.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">The important thing to remember is
            that personality type is only <b>one</b> factor, and in a
            particular case, it may not be the most important one. It
            doesn't substitute for listening to the
            individual.&nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Have you ever had someone pay more attention to what they
            thought about your type than to what you had actually
            said? Or have you seen this happen to someone
            else?&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">I got three responses to this
            question. An INTP and an INFJ just provided their type,
            with no other response. One INTJ wrote the
            following:&nbsp;</font></p>

               "professionals" who do not understand that MB gives a
               general profile and/or indicators. That MB type is, in
               my opinion, a tool to help understand another person
               but not to be used as the only indicator of behavior

            the women who started the MBTI® instrument is
            <b>Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type</b>,
            by Isabel Briggs Myers, Peter B. Myers, a good book, but
            not an easy introduction. For an introduction to type
            from an S perspective, get <b>Your Key to Sports
            Success</b>, by Jonathan Niednagel. An accessible
            all-round introduction is <b>Type Talk</b>, by Otto
            Kroeger with Janet M. Thuesen. <b>Please Understand
            Me</b>, whether the original or the updated <b>II</b>, by
            David Keirsey is a temperament-based introduction to
            Myers-Briggs™ theory which actually is how I got
            started. <b>Personality Type: An Owner's Manual</b>, by
            Lenore Thomson Bentz, is another excellent and detailed
            introduction to type. Look through </font><a href="books.html"><font size="-1">Net

            descriptions of type books relating to relationships,

            <p><font size="-1">Here are a couple of N anecdotes on
            life with an S deficiency.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Several months ago, a co-worker turned
            40. Her office was decorated with black balloons, and
            there were treats in the kitchen. In order to get to my
            desk, I passed both the kitchen, where I noted the
            treats, and her office, where I did not note the
            balloons. I sat down at my desk, and checked my email,
            which is always the first thing I do when I get to work.
            There, I read the email notice that she had turned 40,
            and the treats were in honor of her birthday. I went to
            her office, wished her happy birthday, and told her I
            hadn't even noticed the balloons. I expected a chuckle,
            or at least a smile. I got a strange look
            instead.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Another time, years ago, I had trouble
            telling two fellow students apart. Although they looked
            very similar to me, other students told me they didn't
            look at all alike. I guess they just were about the same
            height and weight with the same color hair.
            Unfortunately, the two didn't particularly like each
            other, so they would be insulted if called by the other's
            name. I spent the whole semester not calling either of
            them by their name.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">These two cases stand out in my mind
            right now, but I also have the usual bruises from not
            seeing moved furniture or open doors, and the cases of
            not being able to find the car.&nbsp;</font></p>

            eight shared their stories, five just registered that
            they had read the article, and one didn't know what I
            meant by the question. To the person who asked that, I
            need to reply that the question wasn't exactly well put.
            Someone with an N preference, may still have very well
            developed S capabilities, and vice versa. I was just
            looking for funny stories.&nbsp;</font></p>

            well. Only when the group is small and intimate can I
            really get into the conversation. Otherwise, I tend to
            retreat into the private world in my head. Sometimes even
            to the point when I don't notice other people around me.

            Me</i></b></font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>
            <i>by Mary Hoerr, July 19, 1999</i>&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">In surfing the web, I came across
            someone who asked what real difference knowing about type
            made to a person. One person emailed me that knowing
            about type would have helped him in school, if he had
            known about it sooner. Others think it helps them
            understand themselves.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">It got me to thinking how it has made
            a difference to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">First of all, it helped me to make
            sense of the different ways people act, and why I
            sometimes unintentionally insulted people (and sometimes,
            unintentionally got a laugh from some wry comment). In
            that respect, it reminds me of when I read a book that
            helped me figure out my "colors" (not type related - just
            clothes related). I'm a "spring". I was very excited,
            because I finally had some theory for understanding why
            some colors "work" together and some don't. I shared my
            discovery with one of my sisters (who is not fashion
            impaired), and she said it was nonsense. Observing her,
            though, I found out that she usually followed the color
            principles of the book. The book *did* oversimplify the
            use of color, just as type theory oversimplifies the
            differences between people. But knowing type helped me
            notice things about the behavior of others that other
            people notice automatically.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Another thing type did was to open up
            different ways of making decisions and viewing the world
            to me. Now that I understand (to some extent) how an F
            decision making process works, and that it isn't just a
            case of emotionalism, I can try to gain some capability
            in that area. Now that I know about the S vs N way of
            seeing the world, I can try to "shift" to an S
            perspective, instead of just wondering why I keep missing
            details.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">Those are two major differences
            knowing type has made to me. How has knowing about type
            made a difference to you?&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1">I got two responses, but
            unfortunately, they gave only their type, and did not
            actually answer the question:&nbsp;<br>

         <p><font size="-1">From time to time, I get email asking me
         about Myers-Briggs™ testing. Before I continue, I must
         make two important points.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">First
         of all, any questionnaire, sorter, or indicator based on
         Myers-Briggs™ theory should not be considered a "test."
         This is an important point, because I don't trust any
         MB-based instrument that doesn't make this clear. Most sites
         have to put the word "test" on their pages somewhere because
         people new to MB always search on "test" - which is why this
         article uses "test." But somewhere, prominantly the site
         should always tell you this is not a test and there are no
         right or wrong answers, just like there's no such thing as a
         right or wrong hair color or town of birth.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Secondly,

         anywhere from $50 to $150 would not be unreasonable, since
         they include at least one hour (and sometimes more) of

         test.&nbsp;</font><br>

         fee or a very small fee, but they are not as reliable, and
         do not include any professional interpretation and
         counselling on the results. Finally, the Benziger Thinking
         Styles Assessment (BTSA) also builds on Myers-Briggs™
         theory, and includes additional analysis to determine if you
