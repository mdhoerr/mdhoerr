         He comes up with some of the same divisions as
         Myers-Briggs™ theory. However, where Myers-Briggs™
         theory sees dichotomies, Friesen sees modes. In a chapter of
         his book, he explains that he sees Myers-Briggs™ theory
         as a subset that can be included in his theory. This is
         truly an entire book on the web, and I didn't get through it

         American infantry ever fired a weapon in combat in World War
         II) and how effective he will be. I was heartened to hear
         that one of the main problems with combat training is just
         getting soldiers to fire. And even when training got the
         firing rates up to 95% by the time of the Vietnam war, it
         still didn't ensure that the bullets would reach their
         targets. Major Pierson's article goes on to provide methods
         to identify whether a soldier is part of the 3-4% of the
         male and 1% of the female population who are "natural
         killers" - i.e., they do not suffer remorse from killing.
         One of the factors is Myers-Briggs™ type, which when
         combined with several other factors, may help identify these
         people. A chilling article, but interesting and appears well

         One interesting item: for the first two years of college,
         the highest grades are earned by IN's, followed by EN's,
         IS's and then ES's. However, <b>from the junior year on,
         there is no difference in academic score</b> among the
         types. The author conjectures that this may be because the
         first&nbsp; two years of college tend to be general
         education courses not directly related to the chosen major,
         and thus are seen by ES and IS types as "<i>obstacles

         utility</i>."</font>&nbsp;</p>

         </font></a><font size="-1">has some interesting ideas on
         Myers-Briggs™ type. He theorizes that our type is a
         "</font><a href="http://www.techsource.com/%7Etim/synthesis.htm"><font size="-1">synthesis</font></a><font size="-1">"
         of two types he calls alpha types. He also posits an
         </font><a href="http://www.techsource.com/%7Etim/interface.htm"><font size="-1">interface
         type</font></a><font size="-1">, which is how we appear when
         we need to interact with the opposing mode of perception.
         According to his theory, when I as an INTP interact using S,
         then my behavioral style is ISFJ (I basically go into my
         tertiary S and inferior Fe). In his theory we do not just
         have shadow <b>function</b> but an entire shadow personality
         type. Interestingly, he claims that this </font><a href="http://www.techsource.com/%7Etim/shadow.htm"><font size="-1">shadow
         personality type</font></a><font size="-1"> is not based on
         the inferior function, but calculates it
         differently.</font></p>
