         tend to express it abstractly (see my articles

         the difference between abstract and concrete creativity may
         still explain many of the problems "N" people have in a
         predominantly "S" world. Teresa has since emailed me that
         she finds more of a connection between creativity and the
         "P" attitude than either the "N" or "S" functions. She

         <i>Type Goes to School</i>, from the TypeWorkS

         of how high school Dean Kristina Giger used temperament at
         her school. Instead of the usual temperament names, she uses
         color-coded categories that students can relate
         to.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         training, parent workshops, classroom demonstrations,
         student presentations, team building, and leadership
         training. Part of his focus is on how to use knowledge of
         type and multiple intelligences in teaching school children.
         In an </font><a href="http://www.rspublishing.com/Personality%20Type.html"><font size="-1">web
         page article</font></a><font size="-1">, he gives an example
         of how sensing children may have a harder time when they
         first start school than intuitive
         children.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         Busse</font></a><font size="-1"> has designed a card game
         that uses the four preferences as card suits. Every player
         gets seven cards. Each player attempts to obtain a hand
         including four preferences for one type, and three of the
         same preferences outside of that type. For example, if your
         hand contains&nbsp; ESFP, then the other three cards would
         all need to be the same preference chosen from the remaining
         I, N, T, and J.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         year law school is set up, not to teach students, but to
         "weed" them out. Reminds me of my first semester as a
         Physics major. She discusses the correlation between type,
         and success in law school, and provides type-related
         suggestions for improving legal pedagogy. For example,
         students with preferences for I and T did better in a study
         of first semester law students.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         gives an overview of temperament, and then describes
         learning styles for each temperament. He also includes a
         survey you can participate in, where you enter your name,
         email, type, and some comments. Most of the entrants are
         N's. Wonder how you could get a survey that would encourage
         the S's to participate?</font>&nbsp;<br>

         from the book describes how the S-N dichotomy affects how a
         student takes a multiple choice test. The author stresses
         that your type preference does not prevent you from learning
         skills associated with the other function preferences. I
         particularly liked one of his quotes: "<i>1.Performing in
         your type is play.&nbsp; 2.Performing in the opposite of
         your type is work."&nbsp;</i></font></p>
