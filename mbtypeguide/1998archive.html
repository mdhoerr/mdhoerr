         <p><font size="-1">When Mary asked me if I would consider
         providing her with a 'guest feature' piece for late
         December, I thought that I might offer one of the articles
         from our on-line journal, '</font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/EMBTI/journal.html"><font size="-1">The
         Enneagram and the MBTI</font></a><font size="-1">', or from
         our site, '</font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/ENSEMBLE"><font size="-1">Personality
         Type, Organizational Form, and the Structure of Human
         Consciousness</font></a><font size="-1">'. Our work on the
         '</font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/ENSEMBLE/mpage3a.html"><font size="-1">Five
         Levels of the Four Jungian
         Functions</font></a><font size="-1">', seems to have
         intrigued her, judging from our conversations. But there are
         also other papers at these sites that might be of general
         interest to the reader - papers on </font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/ENSEMBLE/mpage1a.html"><font size="-1">Organizational
         Development and Type</font></a><font size="-1">, and on
         particular aspects of the MBTI - such as '</font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/EMBTI/j3frames.html"><font size="-1">preference
         orders</font></a><font size="-1">', the </font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/indicators/5level2.html"><font size="-1">'J/P'

         system and how it differs from the MBTI.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">However,
         since the papers published at our sites are readily
         available there, and only a click away from here, I thought
         that maybe I should consider writing something new for this
         occasion. And wouldn't it be nice if the topic was as
         relevant as possible to what Mary herself is trying to do at
         this site. What topic would be appropriate? Perhaps if I
         clarified for myself what it is that is special for me about
         Mary's work, and how that relates to what I am doing, I'd
         have an answer. And then it came to me. Behind the
         underlying design of Mary's site, which artfully brings
         together, in one place, a number of diverse and interesting
         papers on personality, there is an intelligence at work that
         shows high regard for the subtleties of what I would call,
         for lack of a better term, 'theory building'. This may not
         be surprising - as Mary is an INTP. But it actually does
         makes for a unique approach, since so many on-line and
         hardcopy Journals seem to go out of their way to AVOID
         theoretical discussion.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">How
         many times have I heard individuals remark that 'theory' is
         what you get when there is a lack of hard evidence? How
         often have I witnessed theory-building perjoratively
         referred to as 'speculation' or 'nit-picking'? I have always
         been somewhat disturbed by what seems to me to be a lack of
         appreciation for theory and for the role that 'philosophy'
         can play, when appropriately applied, in critiquing
         typologies and generating alternate paradigms for
         consideration in empirical research. But I have hitherto not
         had - or perhaps I have not made - the opportunity to
         address this question publicly. So that's what I'd like to
         do here.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Many
         children come to believe, by virtue of what they are taught
         in grade school, that science proceeds in the following
         fashion - 1) facts present themselves to the researcher, who
         2) creates a hypothesis that seeks to explain the facts,
         after which 3) the hypothesis is tested by gathering
         additional facts of the sort that will support or defeat the
         hypthesis in question. This model, although sometimes
         helpful, is somewhat too simple.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">For
         the theories that we tacitly embrace all too often actively
         shape what we indeed see. Whether or not we consciously
         recognize that this is happening, the conceptual 'models'
         that we use to frame and structure our experience filter out
         certain types of 'object' and/or 'fact' while bringing into
         relief or 'relevating' others. The scientist who does not
         recognize or acknowledge this phenomenon, or is not aware of
         the extent to which it actually occurs in his or her own
         work, is at a distinct disadvantage.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Imagine
         the following scenario. A woman is in a city that is
         unfamiliar to her. She is walking down the street with the
         lover with whom she is having an affair. The streets are
         virtually empty and they are talking. While they walk and
         chat, she is watching the man who is approaching them on the
         sidewalk, with whom she is about to cross paths. Although
         she has been focused on him for the entire period of time it
         has taken him to traverse the hundred yards of distance
         between them, it is not until this man is three feet away
         that she recognizes him to be her husband!&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">What
         happened? Why did she not recognize him sooner? The answer
         is rather simple, actually. At the moment in question she
         was in a context in which he, the husband, was not expected
         to be seen. He was a 'foreign' object in that place at that
         time. The context simply did not 'support' what presented
         itself in front of her - her husband - as something that
         could be singled out as an object of her attention, and so
         she simply could not SEE him.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         is very similar to what Milton Erickson, the father of
         modern hypnotherapy, calls a 'negative hallucination'.
         Erickson was able to induce remarkably strong negative
         hallucinations in individuals in hypnotic trance, causing
         them be unable to see a person sitting in the chair in front
         of them. Even if that individual, who was in effect rendered
         'invisible', were to touch the subject on the arm or take
         something from the table between himself and the subject,
         the subject would invariably continue NOT to notice him.
         Under such circumstances, Erickson has shown, subjects will
         go to great lengths to provide an alternate explanation for
         the event - an elaborate 'rationale' for the mysterious
         phenomena rendered 'anomalous' by the apparent physical
         absence of the individual that was the actual
         cause.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         is not unlike what happens in science when our explanatory
         frameworks make it 'by definition' impossible for us to
         entertain certain kinds of possibilities - an individual
         with an N-F-S-T preference order, for example. We all are
         continually making multiple assumptions about the nature of
         the 'realities' in which we operate, assumptions consistent
         with 'theories' that we embrace. Even when these are tacitly
         held theories and assumptions, as is often the case, they
         bring certain kinds of a propos 'fact' into relief, while
         suppressing other kinds of fact.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         have heard this phenomenon called 'ontological
         gerrymandering' by psychologists and sociologists. But when
         it happens in science it is not usually a deliberate trick
         engaged in to obtain an 'advantage' - as it can be with
         politicians who are inclined to re-draw the boundary-lines
         of the district they represent in order to include more
         voters from their party. The scientist is often less aware
         of the fact that the 'objects' that are of concern to him or
         her are brought into relief as a result of the 'paradigm'
         that he or she holds. Interestingly, these paradigms often
         involve conceptual frames that are 'type-related', as we
         pointed out in a </font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/EMBTI/j3frames.html"><font size="-1">recent
         article </font></a><font size="-1">at our
         site.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Thomas
         Kuhn, who was the philosopher of science who coined the term
         'paradigm shift' back in the 1960s, described an interesting
         psychological experiment in the course of trying to explain
         what it is like to experience such a shift. Pat (Dinkelaker)
         and I used a variation of the experiment to teach managers
         attending an Organizational Development course that we
         taught about paradigm shifts and psychological
         type.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">We
         made a deck of cards like the one in the original
         experiment; unbeknownst to our students, it included an
         anomalous card - a red eight of spades. We could have used a
         black queen of hearts, I imagine, or any non-traditional
         combination of color and suit. We put the anomalous card
         amongst the top 10 cards in the deck and then asked each
         individual in the group to take a turn as the subject of a
         rapid-fire perceptual recognition test, while the others in
         the class watched. We manually turned the top ten cards
         over, one by one, and the student called out the identity of
         the card as soon as he or she could, and then the next card
         was revealed. The answers were recorded.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">In
         the original experiment it was discovered that many
         individuals took significantly longer to identify the
         anomalous card - two, three times as long, or more. Some
         individuals simply could not do it, and even exhibited signs
         of distress. In our version, we permitted a longer period of
         time for the anomalous card, but proceeded to the next card
         if a guess had not been made within a reasonable period, or
         if a wrong guess was made. Some persons would say 'um, uh,
         eight of hearts' - ignoring the fact that the card was
         black. Others would say 'eight of spades' - ignoring the
         heart shapes on the card. Some would hesitate too long,
         apparently confused and momentarily transfixed. Some would
         have slightly puzzled or uncomfortable looks on their faces.
         Some were even motivated to turn their attention elsewhere
         and act as if they have been diverted. One student who found
         himself easily distracted in this way, for instance, looked
         at someone next to him, made a joke, and then covered up
         with a statement like - 'uh, I'm sorry, I'm being distracted
         by So-and-So'.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">After
         the experiment, we asked people about what they had
         experienced. Nobody had noticed that the card was anomalous,
         and nobody seemed to have a second thought about the
         experiment. 'Not very interesting', was the consensus. 'What
         was the point?', they wanted to know. We then asked each
         individual in turn to do a brief 'second round'. This time
         they were instructed to look but say absolutely nothing.
         Each individual was shown the anomalous card, for as long as
         it took him or her to recognize that it was anomalous.
         People seemed to take forever. One looked like she was not
         going to get it, and I discretely moved on. From my vantage
         point, what I saw as I sat across from these individuals and
         carefully watched their faces and postures were mostly blank
         looks at first - some eager to please, some resentful, some
         bored. And then, at some point, you could almost see the
         light going off in the person's head - she would blush, or a
         smile would sweep across her, or there would be a quick
         shift in her posture and then she would suddenly relax and
         sit back in her chair. I could sense the 'felt shift' that
         accompanied recognition, and at that point I'd remind the
         individual to remain silent and I'd turn to the next
         person.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         'second round' energized the group. Now people were
         interested. Something was happening. It is, after all, a
         remarkable thing to experience a paradigm shift from the
         'inside out', as it were - to have a new perspective on
         things suddenly open up for one right on the spot. We talked
         about it afterwards; most were blown away by their tendency
         to see only what they expected to see, and their inability
         to notice the anomalous nature of the card. Could this be
         what it is like to be trapped within the constraints of a
         particular 'personality type'?, we asked. Or - to take this
         to another level - to be fettered by the conceptual
         parameters associated with a particular personality theory
         or a management theory?&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         experiment relies quite heavily, of course, on the fact that
         we have no word for a 'red eight of spades'. In normal card
         games we are used to saying 'the eight of hearts' or 'the
         eight of spades', but would never say 'the red eight of
         hearts', as this would be redundant. Except in the case of
         this special experiment, of course. In my experience
         (although I have not made a formal study of this), when you
         instruct people to identify the color and the suit they are
         in a much better position to recognize the anomaly. This is
         true even if your 'instruction' is only tacit - that is,
         even when you don't give the instruction verbally but model
         the behavior you want by showing a few cards to the group
         and announcing 'red four of hearts', 'black nine of spades',
         and so forth.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">But
         when scientists go about the business of scientific research
         in the real world, there is usually nobody out there to give
         them hints about what the 'right answer' in fact is. There
         is nobody out there who can definitively say, 'here are the
         significant parameters to notice in this case - color and
         suit'. Furthermore - scientists may not realize that the
         theories that they do embrace will tacitly promote certain
         parameters, often the wrong ones. In a world in which people
         believe that the earth is flat, it is unlikely that
         individuals, when asked what their 'cosmological
         assumptions' are, will announce 'I assume that the world is
         flat'. But their perceptions will nonetheless be ruled by
         such assumptions.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">How,
         we might ask, would we go about trying to unearth the
         'assumptions' that underly a particular theory - a
         personality theory, for instance? What tools can we use to
         shine a light into those dark corners where the
         'assumptions' that influence our perceptions are likely to
         hide?&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Often
         it is only when people are presented with an alternative
         model - founded on rival assumptions - that the tacit
         assumptions that underly their current world view are
         effectively revealed. When you stop to think about it, this
         is what makes personality typologies powerful tools in the
         first place - I take for granted my preferences until I
         identify myself as an INFJ and compare this to the 'personal
         paradigm' entailed by being an ESTP, or an INTP, which turn
         out to be radically different.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         fact that assumptions don't just 'reveal themselves' is one
         reason that I personally find comparative typology to be a
         fruitful arena of study, and especially helpful in
         identifying the hard-to-get-at assumptions that underly any
         given model.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">To
         most of us it probably would never have occured, for
         example, that there might be useful alternatives to how the
         16 MBTI types are traditionally grouped in sets of four (ST,
         SF, NF, NT). Not, at least, until Keirsey came along to show
         us that there were other logically consistent ways to parse
         the sixteen into alternate groupings - such as the NT, NF,
         SP, and SJ groups to which he assigned a special meaning.
         But once this did happen, the door was opened forevermore -
         to a number of alternative variations that are equally
         legitimate, as we've shown in a </font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/EMBTI/j3keirsey.html"><font size="-1">recent
         article</font></a><font size="-1">. Someone recently
         contacted me, after reading the article cited above, to
         point out that in the latest issue of the Journal of
         Psychological Type there is a review of an empirical study
         which utilizes one of the alternatives in the set that I was
         able to identify purely by virtue of playing with the
         theoretical possibilities - the SP, NP, TJ and FJ
         alternative.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Interestingly,
         over the years there have been many similar theoretical
         forays into a number of the other assumptions underlying the
         MBTI. As the assumptions that underwrite the system are
         slowly relevated, one by one, and contrasted to rival
         'assumptions', a host of new variations of Jungian typology
         have emerged. See, for instance, the 'Singer-Loomis'
         instrument, or the Cambridge Inventory.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Some
         of the models that are generated in this way may turn out to
         be trivial exercises in imagining what is merely logically
         possible. And some of these systems will likely prove to be
         LESS powerful than the precursor that spawned them -
         dumbed-down versions of a more useful personality model that
         they seek to supplant. But the 'theory building' activity
         itself is nevertheless an important and indispensible part
         of the evolutionary process that insures that personality
         typology will in the long run be capable of changing in
         response to the subtle social and cultural shifts that are
         inevitable as we travel through history as a species. It is
         in celebration of that process, and Mary's site, that I
         offer my above remarks.&nbsp;</font></p>

         <p><b>MBTI® AT WORK&nbsp;</b></p>
         
         <dl>
            <dt><font size="-1">In the last two weeks, I have heard
            some interesting remarks about how the administration and
            effective utilization of the MBTI® was key to the
            success of a comprehensive organization change effort.
            The organization has changed over the last six years from
            a command-and-control, hierarchical, leader-directed
            structure with divisions, branches, and sections, to an
            organization which effectively relies on shared
            leadership, collaboration, and successful teamwork. The
            number of managers has been reduced to just two from
            eight. People are more outspoken and
            interactive.&nbsp;<br>
            </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">A
            driving factor which was significant to the initiation of
            this change effort was the fact that one of the senior
            managers had taken a year off to obtain his master’s
            degree in organizational development. He came&nbsp;back
            to the organization convinced that changes could and
            should be made. The organization had been operating
            largely as an ISTJ type of organization — people
            went about their work as they had always done, with
            little encouragement to do anything other than the
            routine day-to-day work. Opportunities to be creative, to
            think outside the box, to push the envelope, and to be
            well-connected and knowledgeable of the customer’s
            interest were neither openly encouraged nor praised by
            management. People who plateaued in their particular job
            series were not given any specific support or
            encouragement; rather, the sense these people were given
            was that “those are the rules and that’s just
            the way it is and will continue to be.”&nbsp;<br>
            </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Now
            the managers and staff take pride in having more
            effective and efficient workflow operations; true problem
            resolution strategies and process improvement methods;
            higher productivity; greater customer satisfaction;
            improved morale; enhanced skills; better institutional
            knowledge; greater sharing of information; and methods in
            place to ensure continuous improvement.&nbsp;</font></dt>
         </dl>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>THE NF PERSPECTIVE&nbsp;</b><br>
         What happened? Among the changes made, the NF perspective
         became increasingly valued and incorporated into the
         workplace culture. People are now considered to be the most
         valuable resource and are strongly encouraged to share their
         ideas and suggestions and to make improvements as they see
         fit.&nbsp;<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">To
         get to the point where they are now, the organization went
         through six distinct transitional phases: Phase of
         Confusion, Design, Planning, Transition, Implementation, and
         Assessment.&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>PHASE OF CONFUSION</b>&nbsp;<br>
         The initial phase, lasting for about the first year, has
         been referred to as the Phase of Confusion. In this phase,
         the rationale for making changes was discussed thoroughly by
         everyone and the process for moving forward was
         invented.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">This
         was not easy to do, especially since there were as many
         reasons being expressed for not making changes as there were
         for making changes. To complicate matters, those who
         welcomed change had many different ideas about how to
         proceed. During the second phase, which lasted about six
         months, a Design Team was formed and charged with
         determining how the organization should be reorganized. It
         was at this time that a one-day introductory MBTI®
         training program was offered to everyone in the
         organization. In addition to helping everyone to better
         understand their own and others’ preferred work style,
         it gave them a common language and clarified what the
         organizational (and individual) strengths were by virtue of
         the organization’s type table profile.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">This
         knowledge of type and the type results have been
         instrumental in the success of this effort. It helped people
         to explain why they were open to change or hesitant to do
         so, and provided people with an understanding that the
         organization needed to have many diverse strengths rather
         than an isolated few. During this phase, the vision was
         created for the organization. It was determined that the
         following results would indicate that they were a healthy
         organization:&nbsp;<br>

         sense of community responsibility.&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>PLANNING PHASE&nbsp;</b><br>
         The Planning Phase lasted another year. After determining
         what the organization should look like they then addressed
         how they were to get there. They first addressed how work
         was to be assigned. They knew the answer lay in having more
         teamwork. It was determined that their work could be
         organized into four areas, and four teams were created
         — an Analytical Team, an Operations Team, a Quality
         Assurance Team, and a Client Services Team. Each of these
         teams would be structured similarly, each having a
         leadership coordinator (rather than a team leader) and a
         leave coordinator. To give more people the opportunity to
         demonstrate and utilize their leadership skills and
         competencies, it was determined that the only people who
         could apply for the leadership coordinator positions were
         those who were not in designated leadership or supervisory
         positions in the previous organization. This groundrule was
         kept in place for this one year. Once the leadership
         coordinators were selected (by the organization’s
         three-person Leadership and Quality Council), teams were
         formed and leave coordinators were designated. An innovation
         was made to ensure the teams’ members maintained close
         communication and developed a sense of accountability to
         each other. Rather than submitting leave requests to
         supervisors, as had been done in the past, a process was
         created for team members to submit their requests for leave
         to the team’s leave coordinators, who would
         “approve” the leave only when other team members
         had been consulted and were in agreement.&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>TRANSITION PHASE&nbsp;</b><br>
         Phase 4 was the Transition Phase, which lasted about ten
         months. During this phase, training and skill development
         were emphasized as the best ways to prepare people to assume
         new duties and responsibilities. Training sessions included
         such topics as change management (1/2 day), total quality
         management and working in teams (1 day),
         problem-solving&nbsp;tools (1 day), basic facilitation and
         effective meeting management (31/2 days), team leadership
         (five different units, each a day long, for members of the
         Leadership Quality Council and the leadership coordinators),
         MBTI Awareness and Team-building sessions (one day for each
         member of the teams) and Leadership 2000 training (seven
         units for all staff — 1/2 day per
         unit).&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>IMPLEMENTATION PHASE&nbsp;</b><br>
         Next came the actual implementation of the change effort,
         which lasted nearly a year and a half before everything was
         in place as was intended. Once again, training was key
         during this phase. The training was more focused on
         developing specific communication skills to ensure greater
         collaboration and mutual understanding. Managers were given
         training and coaching assistance to ensure that their
         involvement was balanced between “meddling and
         support.” Increasingly, as people acquired these new
         skills, they were given greater personal responsibility and
         trusted to make important decisions. Furthermore, they were
         encouraged to be more creative, spontaneous, and flexible.
         Some of the immediate benefits included improved morale and
         job satisfaction, and reduced process improvement time. Much
         of the feedback received from senior managers, staff, and
         most customers was extremely positive.&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>ASSESSMENT PHASE&nbsp;</b><br>
         As is the case in many organizations today, measuring
         progress and sustaining initial gains (from changing the
         workplace culture and communication patterns), are essential
         next steps. During this Assessment Phase, the organization
         used different evaluations, assessments, and surveys.
         Surveys were taken about the entire organization. Team
         members were asked to assess the team’s abilities and
         areas for improvement, customer surveys were conducted, and
         a supervisory feedback system was put in place. Stakeholder
         meetings were conducted each month. Organization-wide
         meetings were regularly held during which each of the teams
         were asked to present their accomplishments. An annual
         organizational assessment meeting was initiated to review
         accomplishments and to revalidate the mission and vision.
         What this accomplished, in addition to much greater
         communication and sharing of information, was a greater
         sense of accountability and empowerment.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">These
         organizational change efforts are clearly worth the effort!
         People have become inspired, trusted, and more authentic.
         What a difference this has made! Much of the success in this
         case was due to the number of NFs (over 25% of the staff),
         who were instrumental in restructuring the organization.
         Imagine what our workplaces would be like if people could
         truly be themselves and be fully trusted to contribute the
         natural skills and talents which comprise who they are. NFs
         would thrive in such an environment!&nbsp;</font></p>

         <p><a href="http://www.benziger.org/brain1.html"><font size="-1">Dr.
         Benziger</font></a><font size="-1"> tells us that current
         brain research shows that type preferences may be localized
         in the brain. Thinking and Intuition are rooted respectively
         in the much-touted Left Frontal and Right Frontal Lobes,
         referred to in the Benziger Model as Frontal modes. Sensing
         and Feeling are rooted in the Left and Right Posterior
         Cortical Convexities, referred to in the Benziger Model as
         Basal Modes.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">According
         to </font><a href="http://www.braintypes.com/Whatare.htm"><font size="-1">Jonathan
         P. Niednagel</font></a><font size="-1">, each person has one
         of 16 brain types (Myers-Briggs™ types), which he
         describes as inborn, genetically predisposed wiring that
         directly regulates both mental and motor skills. Each Brain
         Type not only has inherent and specific mental proficiencies
         (and deficiencies) but physical ones as well. Thus, he
         determines your brain type by evaluating a video tape you
         send him of yourself answering Myers-Briggs™ type
         questions.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Both
         Benziger and Niednagel believe it is better to operate in
         harmony with your type. Benziger links falsification of type
         (operating primarily outside of one's type preferences) to
         fatigue, illness and depression, among some symptoms.
         Working within one's dominant function leads to energy and
         joy. Niednagel's primary constituency comprises athletes and
         sports enthusiasts, who he feels can improve their
         performance through a knowledge of type. He considers that
         "each Brain Type has one-of-a-kind body/motor skills, too."
         This implies different training programs based on type, but
         also that different types are better fitted for different
         sports.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">If
         a simple physical test can be devised to determine type, as
         Niednagel expects, then I can imagine kids, at the college
         level at least, being screened not only based on height and
         weight and athletic skill, but on type. Or if Dr. Benziger's
         test is as accurate as she claims in determining type, and
         when someone is falsifying type, that I could imagine a
         company insisting, for example, that anyone who does not
         test as an extrovert be prevented from entering sales.<br>

         I think it is very good for people to know their type, and
         to know and respect the types of others. Dr. Benziger wants
         to use her assessment tool as a means of "</font><a href="http://www.benziger.org/index.html"><font size="-1">Helping
         People Thrive</font></a><font size="-1">." Mr. Niednagel
         thinks that "<i>by learning this invaluable information, you
         can better communicate with and persuade others, develop
         hidden talents (mentally and physically), and enjoy numerous
         other rewards.</i>" But I have also seen people use
         knowledge of type as an excuse not to exercise their
         nonpreferences when necessary, or as negative expectations
         of others of different types.<br>

         that people with strong preferences would be less flexible,
         and therefore more resistant to counseling. Others don't
         like to say they have a preference for one function or
         another because they feel it is "better" or more "well
         rounded" to be equally capable of exercising either
         function. Other material that speaks of developing the less
         preferred functions seems to feed into this idea that it is
         better not to have any preference, which theory says is not
         possible (probable?) or to have only a weak
         preference.&nbsp;<br>

         is actually not the position of any Myers-Briggs™
         material I have read. The authors are very careful to point
         out that it is not better or worse to have strong vs weak
         preferences, just as it is not better or worse to have one
         preference or another. There are advantages and
         disadvantages either way. The one thing they seem to agree
         on is that it is necessary to develop one's preferred
         functions first, before working on the less preferred
         functions.&nbsp;<br>

         I have an extreme preference for I, a strong preference for
         N, and a very slight preference for P. In fact, my
         preference for P was so slight that I was initially puzzled
         by books that described this as one of the easiest
         preferences to spot when you first meet a person. And my
         preference for I was so strong that I was amazed to learn
         that some people actually get energized by being around
         other people. The idea that a party might NOT wear someone
         out was news.&nbsp;<br>

         are the advantages and the disadvantages I have found for
         strong vs weak preferences:&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>The extreme preference</b>: I
            am very much at home and comfortable with my
            introversion. It was very useful for me to learn how
            extroversion works, so that I no longer think of such
            people as being "all talk" or obtrusive. Since I now have
            a positive model of what extroversion is, it is easier
            for me to exercise that option when needed, although it
            will never be easy (which doesn't bother
            me).&nbsp;</font>
            
            <p><font size="-1"><b>The slight preference:</b> I have
            the most conflicts in the J-P area. On the one hand, I am
            very able to understand both orientations, and often work
            as a sort of "go-between" between the J and P cultures
            that exist at any workplace. But neither am I really
            comfortable or at home in either orientation. When I am
            acting "J", I feel hemmed in, when I'm acting "P", I feel
            disorganized.&nbsp;</font></p>
            
            <p><font size="-1"><b>The strong preference:</b> I have
            what I think is the best combination of comfort and
            flexibility in N-S area. I have a strong preference for
            N, and feel very developed and at home in this area.
            However, I'm close enough to S, and exercise that
            preference often enough to feel reasonably capable there
            too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p></blockquote>

         Albritton, for the second time. They don't so much give type
         profiles as describe how the various functions interact in
         different situations. I liked this book because it helped me
         to see how different preference combinations interact in
         different situations. It also helped me see where I might
         have communication problems.&nbsp;<br>

         books on type provide a description of the two attitudes
         (I-E), the four functions (S-N, T-F) and the two
         orientations (J-P). Then they provide a series of questions
         for you to answer and score to determine you type. Roger R.
         Pearman and Sarah C. Albritton take a different approach. As
         each preference is described in detail, the reader is asked
         to "sort" them, or determine which fits better. In one
         respect, the entire book is a preference "sorter", with the
         reader continually asked to compare his or her estimates of
         type preference to the next set of descriptions. The result
         is less quick than the questions, but it seems to me that to
         the reader willing to take the time, it may be more
         accurate.&nbsp;<br>

         outer image</b>, or first impression, seems to be determined
         mainly by our E-I and J-P preferences. In other words, the
         first impression people get of me is based primarily on my
         IP preference.&nbsp;<br>

         type also experiences <b>inner tension</b> between outer
         orientation and inner mental work. My outer orientation is
         P. My inner function is T. Therefore, my inner tension is
         TP. This tension is good, but it is also a place where each
         type can get "stuck". For example, every week I put together
         the link reviews and features for this site. The tension is
         between my desire to gather more and more data (more links,
         read more books, etc.) and the need to stop the data
         collection and actually analyze it and put something
         together.&nbsp;<br>

         is the <b>cognitive core</b>, which is where each type is
         most comfortable, along with possible behaviors if the
         person is kept from this preferred place too often. The
         cognitive core is simply the two functions for each type,
         the perceiving function and the judging function. For me,
         that makes my cognitive core NT.&nbsp;<br>

         if this is contrasted with temperament theory, we see that
         for sensors temperament is determined by the inner tension
         preferences, SJ and SP, while for intuitives, temperament is
         determined by the cognitive core, NT and NF. In <i>Four
         Spiritualities: Expressions of Self, Expressions of Spirit:
         A Psychology of Contemporary Spiritual Choice</i>, by Peter
         Tufts Richardson, reviewed briefly in my </font><a href="books.html#PrayerTemperamentMichaelNorrisey"><font size="-1">Books</font></a><font size="-1">
         section, spiritual expression is related to this cognitive
         core rather than to temperament.&nbsp;<br>

         is an extensive section on type-related communication
         issues. The authors describe the kind of information each
         type is attracted to, how they express themselves, what
         information they trust, what they consider honest, what
         preconceptions and prejudices they have, what their hot
         buttons are, suggestions for restating information for each
         type, and so on. This really helped me see some
         communications problems I've had in the past. For example,
         one of my hot buttons has been people who will not "listen
         to logic." I wrote about an argument I had with my sister
         because of that in my article "</font><a href="1998archive.html#09141998logical"><font size="-1">It's
         Only Logical</font></a><font size="-1">". On the other hand,
         a hot button for an ESFP might be "people who detach from a
         situation" or for an ESFJ might be "cool, detached people
         who are more interested in their own thoughts than in
         sharing with others" or for an ISFJ might be "debate,
         argument, or sustained disagreement." I can see a number of
         collision courses there!&nbsp;<br>

         growing up was called <i>Little Boxes</i>. It was a song
         about forcing people to conform to stereotypes. The houses
         were "boxes" and although they were many different colors,
         they were "all made out of ticky tacky and they all looked

         charge against using Myers-Briggs™ type is that it
         reduces people to stereotypes. In fact, there is even a
         stereotype about who likes to stereotype. As Corey points
         out in his Observations (no longer available on the web),
         although individuality would seem to be more of an NF issue,
         it is his SJ acquaintances who seem more likely to object
         that the people can't and shouldn't be
         categorized.&nbsp;<br>

         the one hand, we are categorizing people all the time. As
         </font><a href="http://www.monumental.com/oka/"><font size="-1">Otto
         Kroeger and Janet Thuesen</font></a><font size="-1"> point
         out in <i>TypeTalk</i>, "... it's almost second nature for
         us to pigeonhole and catalog people around us, though not
         always accurately or positively." They go on to note that
         typewatching is "based on the notion that as long as we're
         going to do it, we might as well do it as skillfully,
         objectively, and constructively as possible."&nbsp;<br>

         positive side of using type is that it identifies other
         areas where we can develop strengths. As long as we think
         that our own preferences are the rule for everyone else,
         Thinkers are less likely to see a reason to develop their
         Feeling judgment, Intuitives to develop their attention to
         the here-and-now, and so on.&nbsp;<br>

         there are dangers to the use of type as well. Maybe the SJ's
         are seeing a very real and present problem with Type
         watching. Scott Arbuthnot in his article speaks of someone
         who was convinced that they could not be artistic because of

         typical descriptions which he states want to "identify the

         when they write that "The two preferences of sensation and
         intuition are, of any of the preferences, the source of the
         most miscommunication, misunderstanding, vilifications,
         defamation and denigration. <i>This difference places the

         sensor sees the intuitive's hunches as hocus-pocus. The
         intuitive sees the sensor's realism as unimaginative. Of
         course, that is the negative side of extreme and unbalanced
         intuition or sensing. To try to get a handle on the
         differences, I came up with the following metaphor, based on
         two different kinds of computer graphics software.&nbsp;<br>

         compare sensors to "Paint" programs, in which the artist
         directly manipulates the picture, pixel by pixel if she
         wishes. By defining the precise color, point by point, based
         on input from the senses, the sensor builds up a picture of
         the world. This is how I think artists work. It also
         correlates with what I have read in <i>Drawing on the Right
         Side of the Brain</i> by Betty Edwards. She makes the
         interesting point that people have trouble drawing because
         they have lost the ability to simply "see" what is there.
         Through several exercises, she teaches you to "turn off"
         what I might call intuition, and "turn on"
         sensing.&nbsp;<br>

         compare intuitives to "Draw" programs, in which the artists
         defines a few important points, and then selects a shape to
         fit the points. The intuitive first determines the
         applicable "equation", so to speak, and then the lines are
         drawn according to the equation, and not pixel by pixel. The
         advantage of this approach is that it is easier to extend
         the equation "off the page" so to speak. It is easier to
         move the shapes around or change them. The disadvantage is
         that you cannot match the detail or realism, or perhaps even
         the expressiveness, of the "paint" program.&nbsp;<br>

         from, you will realize that his "hunches" are not

         Your Management Style: Beyond the Myers-Briggs Type

         applies type theory and much more to the way managers
         operate. I found most interesting the distinction between
         type preferences, which are essentially given, and needs,
         which are formed by interaction with the environment. Needs
         are independent of type - for example, an introvert can
         still have high exhibition needs.&nbsp;<br>

         Benfari uses the example of how the ENTJ, sometimes called
         the "commandant" type, can differ depending on the person's
         needs. "One ENTJ may have high needs for dominance and
         achievement, while another may have high needs for
         achievement and affiliation. The ENTJ manager will probably
         have a bossy, domineering leadership style, while the second
         will be a participatory leader."&nbsp;<br>

         was surprised to find that Dr. Benfari separates out a need
         for affiliation (to be part of a group) from the need for
         nurturance (to help others). I'm low on affiliation, high on
         nurturance. In other words, I like to help others
         (especially if it makes me look smart ;-) but I don't really
         like to be around them much. On second thought, that doesn't
         sound so surprising after all!&nbsp;<br>

         too obviously "right" and "wrong" answers in these areas.

         <p><font size="-1">Although there are only four preferences,
         and sixteen types, there is considerable variation in the
         degree of each preference. My husband and I are both
         introverts, for example, but I am so introverted that he
         almost seems an extravert compared to me. Is it better to
         have well defined preferences, or to be on the

         course, "better" is a loaded term, and makes no sense in

         both ways. It is much more comfortable for me to function in
         the I vs E dimension. I have a well-defined "home" in my
         introverted preference, even when I have to expend energy to
         extravert. But I am limited in how far I can actually go in

         since I am able to function so well in the J mode while
         still understanding the P mode, I get caught in situations
         where I have to bring the necessary minimum amount of order

         <p><font size="-1">One of the things I loved about
         Myers-Briggs™ typing when I first learned about it was
         that it helped me understand the differences between myself
         and others without having to judge those differences as
         faults or illnesses. I liked the way each type was described
         in positive terms. But a problem we have is that our own
         preferences bias our descriptions of other types, so that
         while they are not exactly wrong, they still seem to be
         missing the point. In this article, I will discuss how NT
         type descriptions seem to "miss the point" on NT
         spirituality.&nbsp;<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">In
         reading descriptions of spirituality in general, or NT
         spirituality in particular, I am struck by how others often
         seem to miss the point. I don't know how many times I've
         read or been told in Bible studies or religious groups that
         we shouldn't "just" read books, or "just" analyse the text,
         or "just" have an intellectual exercise. To the extent that
         those warnings were meants to call us to help other people,
         they are understandable. However, I usually understood a
         subtext that study and intellectual analysis was not quite
         "spiritual" or that it didn't really touch our deep feelings
         or call forth an emotional response.&nbsp;<br>

         my deepest spiritual emotional and spiritual responses have
         often occurred in the course of study or trying to
         understand some aspect of my faith or the world. There is a
         reason that NT scientists refer to theories or formulas or
         equations as "beautiful", "elegant", or "ugly". These are
         not empty phrases. In college physics, we spent two
         semesters studying electricity and magnetism, until we
         finally came to the famous e =
         mc</font><font size="-2"><sup>2</sup></font><font size="-1">.
         I still remember the amazement and joy I felt as all the
         increasingly complicated equations finally came together in
         one simple equation. Let there be light!&nbsp;<br>

         that here, because first of all it would sound distinctly

         is no doubt that this is probably not a usual path to
         spiritual experience for the other types. And perhaps there
         is a certain reaction against this type of spirituality, as
         Michael and Norrisey state in </font><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0940136023/qid%3D906928179/002-5371418-4116849"><font size="-1">Prayer

         it makes no sense to tell NT's to avoid intellectualizing

         that you reach her heart, both emotionally and

         <blockquote><font size="-1">... many INTJs do not readily
            grasp the social rituals; for instance, they tend to have
            little patience and less understanding of such things as
            small talk and flirtation (which most types consider half
            the fun of a relationship). To complicate matters, INTJs
            are usually extremely private people, and can often be
            naturally impassive as well, which makes them easy to
            misread and misunderstand. Perhaps the most fundamental
            problem, however, is that INTJs really want people to
            make sense. :-) This sometimes results in a peculiar
            naivete', paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of
            expecting inexhaustible affection and empathy from a
            romantic relationship, the INTJ will expect inexhaustible
            reasonability and directness.&nbsp;</font></blockquote>

         <p><font size="-1">Several years ago, I had an argument with
         my sister over an issue that meant a great deal to us. I
         made a logical argument against her position that she was
         unable to refute. And yet, it seemed to make not the
         slightest difference to the position she held. At the time,
         I was extremely frustrated, and could not understand what
         was wrong with her. I have since come to believe that she
         was absolutely right in not allowing herself to be convinced
         by my arguments.&nbsp;<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="1998archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">As
         an INTP, I am not just a "T", but T is my dominant function.
         My sister uses F values to make judgements. It has been a
         long and rocky road to the realization that logic is not the
         only, or even necessarily the best way to make decisions.
         I've come to the conclusion that when making the decisions
         most important to us, we should finally rely on our dominant
         function, whichever that may be.&nbsp;<br>

         does not mean that F's cannot or should not listen to or use
         logic. It simply means that when considering changing a
         strong belief, logic should be only one factor, not the
         deciding one. It was perfectly correct for my sister not to
         convinced by logic alone. On the other hand, it is not a
         sign that a T has no feelings when she refuses to be
         convinced on the basis of feeling arguments alone.&nbsp;<br>

         this mean that T's and F's shouldn't try to affect each
         other's beliefs? I don't think so. If the T respects the F,
         then the T will accept the F's feeling argument, think about
         it, analyse it, and attempt to recast it in a logical style
         that she can accept. Respectively, if the F cares about the
         T, she will take the logical argument and attempt to recast
         it using feeling values.&nbsp;<br>
