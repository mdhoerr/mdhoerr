         <p><font size="-1">Modern movies seem to stress the
         importance of subjective Feeling over objective Feeling. The
         bad guys are the parents that want to arrange a marriage;
         the good guys are the star-crossed lovers. The Richard Rich
         video, <b><i>The Swan Princess</i></b>, is different in
         giving equal weight to both aspects.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">The
         widowed parents of Derek and Odette decide they want their
         children to marry, so that the two kingdoms can be united.
         This is clearly an extraverted Feeling goal. The Feeling
         value is the uniting of the two kingdoms, and it doesn't
         particularly matter that Derek is a little boy and Odette
         still a baby. However, rather than directly impose their
         judgement on the children Queen Uberta (Derek's mother) and
         King William (Odette's father) hope that the children will
         fall in love if they are just brought together every summer
         and get to know each other.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Summer
         after summer the two grow up from small children to
         pre-teens to teenagers, during which time "<i>the only thing
         on which they didn't disagree was that the very thought of
         summertime was dreaded.</i>" The scenes of the constant
         sparring are hilarious, but there is an underlying wisdom to
         the approach. Subjective feeling, Fi, when undeveloped, just
         tells us what we like or don't like, and the two children
         are quite vocal about that. But if Fi is to reach the
         ability to identify likes and dislikes with universal human
         value, it needs data or experience. The summers together
         provide just the experience needed to inform developing
         Fi.<br>

         result is a first for fairy tales, as far as I know. As
         young adults, the two finally realize they have fallen in
         love. Fe values and Fi values have come into perfect
         alignment. Tongue-tied Derek doesn't know what to say, and
         ends up giving an answer that sounds like all he cares about
         is Odette's beauty. Derek, the only fairy tale prince who
         actually <b><i>knows</i></b> the beautiful princess before
         falling in love with her, gets himself accused of not caring
         about her as a person!<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Although
         Queen Uberta and King William have cleverly arranged things
         as best they could to get the two to fall in love, when
         Odette makes the decision not to marry Derek, they honor the
         subjective Feeling values represented. Marriage for beauty
         alone is not acceptable, and other arrangements will now
         have to be made to assure the next generation of rulers in
         both kingdoms. Then, the main part of the video begins.

         <p><font size="-1">The feeling function makes rational
         decisions based on value criteria. We tend to think of
         "feeling" as being subjective. But according to type theory,
         this is only true of introverted feeling. Value judgements
         can be based on either objective or subjective criteria,
         where objective means "existing in the outer world" and
         subjective means "experienced in the inner world". If that
         sounds like the difference between extraverted and
         introverted, you're right. Extraverted Feeling is objective,
         Introverted Feeling is subjective. </font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">According
         to Lenore Thomson (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06212000ref"><font size="-1">ref</font></a><font size="-1">)
         "<i>Introverted Feeling relies on the inward, right-brain
         criteria of experience and empathy to mark off decisions
         that go beyond our roles in society to affect as a human
         beings.</i>"</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">It's
         easy to see how value judgements can be subjective.
         Introverted Feeling, the dominant functions for ISFP and
         INFP types, determines the value of something by our inner
         feelings about it, rather than by social norms. On the
         mundane level, Fi just tells us whether we're happy or sad
         about something, whether we like it or not. On a more
         serious level, Fi tells us that it is more important to
         attend a funeral and express grief in whatever clothes we
         have, than to stay away just because we don't have the right
         color costume. The drawback of Fi is that it can mistake
         mere personal preference (I like this kind of music) for
         universal human values (this is the only good kind of
         music). At its best, it connects us to univeral human values
         (music is good).</font><br>

         to Lenore Thomson (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06212000ref"><font size="-1">ref</font></a><font size="-1">)
         "<i>Extraverted Feeling relies on the outward, left-brain
         criteria of custom and law to mark off decisions that go
         beyond our immediate experience to affect the larger
         community.</i>"</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Extraverted
         Feeling, the dominant function of ESFJ and ENFJ types, is
         objective. How can value judgements be objective? When they
         are based on collective social norms. People don't follow
         social norms primarily because they "feel like it", but
         because they want to show how they value something in a way
         most people will understand. On the mundane level, dressing
         up for an occassion shows what kind of value you place on
         it. How you dress up for any specific occassion will depend
         on your culture. For example, a Chinese person may wear
         white to a funeral, while an American will wear black. On a
         more serious level, Fe tells us it is wrong to go back on a
         contractual agreement, even if we know we would never get
         caught. Our personal wrongdoing can have important
         consequences to the community at large. The drawback of Fe
         is that we can mistake the form of the social norm (wear
         black to funerals to show mourning) with the spirit of the
         social norm (show and share your grief in community). At its
         best, it connects us to the important values of our
         culture.</font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">Are some functions "right brain or left
         brain" functions? Are some types? According to Thomson
         (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06142000ref1"><font size="-1">ref
         1</font></a><font size="-1">) and Niednagel

         2</font></a><font size="-1">), the answer to the first
         question is a qualified no, and to the second is yes. All
         four functions, S, N, F and T are found on both sides of the
         brain. However, the introverted and extraverted form of each
         function are on opposite sides of the brain.</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">The
         left side of the brain tends to process information
         linearly. "<i>The left brain processes information one thing
         at a time. If it has to deal with many issues, it will
         organize them sequentially or numerically.</i>"
         (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06142000ref1"><font size="-1">ref
         1</font></a><font size="-1">) This side of the brain is

         right side of the brain tends to process information
         holistically. "<i>The right brain is designed to process
         many things at once and to apprehend them in whole patterns.
         It does not recognize sequence or abstraction.</i>"
         (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06142000ref1"><font size="-1">ref
         1</font></a><font size="-1">) This side of the brain is

         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Interestingly,
         if you look at the functions of each type, you will notice
         that the dominant and auxiliary function of each type are
         activated on the same side of the brain. Those types which
         prefer to extravert their perceiving function (P preference)
         use the right side of the brain for their dominant and
         auxiliary: ISTP, ESTP, ISFP, ESFP, INTP, ENTP, INFP, ENFP.
         Those types which prefer to extravert their judging function
         (J preference) use the left side: ISTJ, ESTJ, ISFJ, ESFJ,
         INTJ, ENTJ, INFJ, ENFJ.</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">By
         the way, this method of mapping type functions to areas of
         the brain is different from Dr. Benziger's method. She
         locates N and F in the right brain, and T and S in the left
         brain. (</font><a href="2000Q2archive.html#06142000ref3"><font size="-1">ref
         3</font></a><font size="-1">). Rather than going strictly by
         the dominant and auxiliary functions, she assesses which
         quadrants of the brain you tend to activate most: some
         people are Quarter Brain Experts (25%), most are Half
         Brainers (55%), some are Triple Brainers (15%) and a few are
         Whole Brainers (5%). Roughly speaking, if Half Brain
         dominance correlates to dominant and auxiliary functions,
         then all NF's are right brainers, all ST's are left
         brainers, and NT's and SF's use a quadrant from each side of
         the brain.</font></p>

         this I don't mean to imply that all autistic individuals are
         ISTP or INTP. However, it does appear to me that autistic
         individuals may have a greater development or access to the
         introverted functions than nonautistic people. However, the
         personality of a specific autistic individual will vary
         depending on which of the introverted functions are dominant
         (and, of course depends on many other factors than
         personality type, which is all I'm dealing with here.)
         Ability to function in the outside world may be at least
         partly related to the amount of access to and development of
         at least one extraverted function.</font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">I have just finished reading Dr. Temple
         Grandin's book, <b><i>Thinking in Pictures: And Other
         Reports From My Life With Autism</i></b>, about her
         experiences and thought processes. Although the book never
         refers to type, it was impossible for me to read without
         thinking of type. I've often thought that descriptions of
         Asperger's syndrome, a from of high functioning autism,
         which is what Dr. Grandin has, sounded a bit like some of
         the INTP descriptions I've read.</font><br>

         her book, and re-reading <b><i>Personality Type:&nbsp;An
         Owner's Manual</i></b>, and <b><i>Your Key to Sports
         Success</i></b>, it occurred to me that one aspect of autism
         may be problems with access to the extroverted parts of the
         brain.</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">One
         aspect of autism appears to be sensory processing problems.
         Autistic people show immature development of the cerebellum,
         part of which acts as a volume control for the senses, and
         of the brain stem, which also has some role in sensory
         processing. Thus, the senses may not be interpreted or
         processed correctly in some autistic people. The input they
         get from their senses ranges from mild oversensitivity to
         jumbled, inaccurate information, both visually and aurally.
         Dr. Grandin states: "<i>Those who escape the prison of
         low-functioning autism probably do so because just enough
         undistorted information gets through. </i><b><i>They do not
         totally lose contact with the world around them.</i></b>" pp
         52, 53 [emphasis mine] I wonder whether this may
         also indicate difficulty in accessing extraverted functions,
         which by definition deal with the outer world.</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">The
         introverted functions are in the posterior of the forebrain.
         This part of the forebrain gathers and handles input from
         the outside world, received via the senses, and translates
         this input into meaning. Specifically, the primary visual
         cortex of this part of the brain is where the process of
         visual imaging begins. The parietal cortex, also part of the
         posterior of the forebrain, integrates sensory inputs,
         handling spatial relations among parts of the body and
         between the body and objects of the outside
         world.</font><br>
         <font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Problems
         with sensory processing may have several effects. First, the
         autistic person may need to spend more time with sensory
         processing - ie, with introverted functions. This may be a
         factor in the difficulty autistic people have with changing
         focus. Second, the information that the extraverted portions
         of the brain have to work with may be suspect. This may lead
         to hesitation in taking action in the outside world, and may
         be a factor in lack of flexibility and difficulty with
         change.</font><br>

         <p><font size="-1">Several times in my life I have
         experienced something I came to call "clear sight". No, it
         had nothing to do with clairvoyance or anything psychic. In
         fact, just the opposite. I called it "clear sight" because I
         was able to "see" (and hear and sense) things clearly as
         they actually are.&nbsp;<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">One
         experience was when I was practicing soccer. There was a
         measureless and miraculous moment when I clearly saw where
         all the players were, and knew exactly where the ball was
         going and how I needed to physically move myself to get to
         the ball and gain control. I don't remember whether I
         actually got the ball - sensing and doing are two different
         things - but I clearly saw all the sensory factors of the
         game.&nbsp;<br>

         understand that I am not talking about predicting or seeing
         what wasn't there. I was seeing precisely and only what was
         there. Sensors will immediately know what I'm talking about,
         but I imagine they will wonder what I'm making such a big
         deal about.&nbsp;<br>

         we think of intuitives as "creative" and sensors as grounded
         in the "here and now", but I think that misses something.
         The experience of "clear sight" has occurred only a few
         times in my life, bright and vivid in my memory. I can't
         help but think that it must be the usual way for a mature
         sensor to see the world.&nbsp; </font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">I worked at a major corporation (Company
         A) as a Total Quality Management (TQM) consultant. The new
         general manager at our facility had been exposed to type
         information at his last position, and he wanted to do the
         same again. Before I arrived, he had his former consultant
         visit our facility. They used the information collected to
         threaten the managers into compliance with his new "TQM"
         program. Needless to say, by the time I arrived, the
         managers and staff were very hostile to me and to any type
         of Organizational Development (OD) intervention.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         was sent to a class that the consultant and others at
         Company B had developed. After the first couple of days, I
         registered complaints about how the information was being
         used in Company A. Personal information derived from the
         classes was used against people when they returned to their
         worksite. It was suggested that the source of my complaining
         was due to my "borderline" condition and the observation
         that I was "just not getting it". I was kicked out of class
         for "not getting it". I was reinstated by the director of
         Company B after explaining to him some of the political
         situation, as long as I agreed not to talk in the
         class.</font><br>

         I got back to work (this class was held over several months,
         with breaks in between), I started administering Ned
         Hermann's Whole Brain "test" (HBDI) in my division. Several
         people did not want to take the test, because they thought
         that it would be used against them. I asssured them that our
         division was not going to participate in those types of
         activities going on at Company B. Later, I became very
         concerned when the General Manager mentioned that he was
         going to fire another manager because he was a feeling type.
         He said, "That type of behavior may be OK for my wife, but
         not for a manager here at _______!!" When I went back to the
         Company B, all hell broke loose (OK, I refused to keep
         quiet!). I also scheduled an evening meeting with the VP of
         corporate HR at Company A, to tell him what was going on. I
         was especially concerned about the potential removal of
         personality types that have a gender component, (like T-F)
         which I consider to be a serious discriminiation
         issue.</font><br>

         I finished the class, I gave the rest of the HBDI forms to
         staff. I coached several very frightened employees on how to
         fudge the scores to come out with a higher A and lower C
         quadrant score (which correspond to Jung's Thinking and
         Feeling types). Later that week, I was fired "for being a
         feeling type". I was told that the only way to get through
         to these managers, "and their projecting" was "to bust them
         over the heads with it", and clearly I was not up to that. I
         threw the completed HBDI forms in the trash.</font><br>

         of all, any questionnaire, sorter, or indicator based on

         is an important point, because I don't trust any MB-based
         instrument that doesn't make this clear. Most sites have to
         put the word "test" on their pages somewhere because people
         new to MB always search on "test" - which is why this
         article uses "test." But somewhere, prominantly the site
         should always tell you this is not a test and there are no
         right or wrong answers, just like there's no such thing as a
         right or wrong hair color or town of birth.</font><br>

         by Roger R. Pearman, describes leadership as a psychological
         process that is influenced by the "habits of mind" that each
         leader has. These "habits of mind" are defined by our type.
         He then shows how each leadership process, from
         "communication" to "problem management" and more, are
         affected by these habits of mind. </font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Pearson
         provides a lot of detailed information about each type's
         approach to many leadership issues. In the section
         discussing communication, for example, he provides a short
         description of the General Style, Potential Miscues, Core
         Beliefs and Reality Checks (kinds of information that type
         tends to discount) for each habit of mind. Thus, an INTP's
         questioning might be a miscue that is seen by others as
         disrespect, while an ESFJ's sympathetic attitude might be
         misread as indicating agreement. An ENFP might need to
         consider conventional answers to provide a reality check,
         while an ISTJ might need to consider emotional
         responses.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         book is full of such matrices for many aspects of
         leadership. What does each habit of mind trust or mistrust?
         The INFP expects ideas to be meaningful, and distrusts
         actions that look harmful to others. The ESTJ trusts facts
         and past experience, and doubts the ability of those who do
         not provide a thorough analysis. What does fairness look
         like to each type? Dependability? Supportiveness? A
         supportive ISTP will make candid statements about what is
         currently happening. That doesn't look supportive to an
         ISFP, who is looking for demonstrations of caring. And there
         are many more charts for other processes.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">An
         interesting one to me was the section on blind spots. One
         chart shows the qualities that each type sees in itself. A
         second shows which of those qualities that observers also
         see in that type. And the last chart shows qualities that
         observers don't see that the type thinks it has. For
         example, an INTP may see herself as independent, flexible

         <p><font size="-1">If type theory is used properly, it seems
         to me that most of the time it should improve the work
         environment by showing people other ways of relating to the
         world. For example, it would show folks with the S
         preference that N is not flighty, folks with E that I's
         aren't suspicious and secretive, etc.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Yet
         there is great concern. One should differentiate between
         function capabilities needed for a job (ie, logical
         analysis, people skills, etc) and the types of people who
         apply for the job. It may make sense to analyse a team and
         say the new hire should be good at "N" or "S" or whatever.
         In fact, type theory may open the mind of management to the
         fact that N or F or P capabilities are actually
         important.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">But
         this is entirely different from saying you should hire
         someone with those preferences. Someone with an S preference
         may very well have highly developed N - in fact, may have
         more developed N than someone with a natural N
         preference.</font><br>

         because you have a preference does <i>not</i> necessarily
         mean you are good at that function. For many reasons, you
         may actually have developed another function to a higher
         level than your preferred function.</font><br>

         what about stereotyping? Doesn't everyone have a unique
         personality, not just one predetermined one out of 16
         possible? Isn't it psychologically damaging to impose a
         stereotype on people?</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Of
         course, everyone has a unique personality, just as everyone
         has a unique fingerprint. And yet, fingerprints can be
         classified according to certain general characteristics.
         Every INTP is like every other INTP in some ways, and
         completely different in other ways. Strength of preferences,
         development of nonpreferences, and many other factors go to
         make up our personality.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">As
         for stereotyping, any classification scheme is open to that.
         Yet the question as to whether the MBTI® instrument
         classification system does more harm than good is an ongoing
         one that I wrestle with.</font><br>

         <i>they</i> perceive the world is the correct one. If the
         MBTI® instrument can open them up to other equally valid
         ways, then it is useful. If it merely provides another
         excuse to discount what those "crazy N's" or "uncreative

         when each function develops. During adolescence, the focus
         is more on the auxiliary. Then, in young adulthood (about 20
         - 35 years old), the tertiary is developed. Finally, the
         inferior starts getting the focus, about the time some folks
         have a mid-life crisis. Please note that these ages are very
         *rough* guidelines. Also note that my understanding is that
         people do not usually develop the tertiary, and certainly
         not the inferior, in the same way and to the same extent as
         the dominant function - and some experts aren't even sure it
         would be healthy if they did.</font><br>

         does this mean to your career search? Well, career goals and
         focus may very well change as a your career progresses.
         During the initial job search phase, from late adolescence
         to early adulthood, you will usually want something in line
         with your dominant and auxiliary functions. Perhaps you will
         have some interest in the tertiary as well. As an INTP, this
         means the first jobs I were attracted to involved science,
         especially in the aerospace industry (which appealed to both
         Ne and Ti). My tertiary didn't interest me much, although I
         used it to get involved in some computer support (which back
         in the mid 80's was something reserved for clerical support
         and lowly second lieutenants).</font><br>

         support, and a 40-year-old is striking. The main difference
         I can see is simply more development of Fe. I think I am
         just better at communicating with people and understanding
         their point of view than I ever was when I was younger. I

         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Recently,
         I&nbsp;have become fascinated by the different roles the
         tertiary and inferior function play. When we use our
         dominant function too much, we lose balance between the
         inner and outer worlds. Here, "balance" doesn't mean
         fifty-fifty, but simply enough recognition of the attitude,
         or world, that is not dominant. When this happens, we should
         use the auxiliary function (which always has the opposite
         attitude to the dominant) to bring us into better balance.
         To do this, the auxiliary function cannot be used in its
         usual role of supporting the dominant function, but needs to
         "become" dominant.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">In
         other words, an INTP can use dominant Ti so much that she
         doesn't maintain enough perspective from the outer world.
         Instead of just using Ne to gather more "stuff" for Ti to
         analyze, she needs to view herself as one of the elements in
         the *outer* world that Ne perceives.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">When
         a type becomes unbalanced, the inferior tries to pull it
         back. But the person is likely to misread the messages as an
         outer phenomenon, instead of a message for balance. When Fe
         sends messages to an INTP to look for the appreciation and
         approval of others in the *outer* world, she is likely to
         feel instead that "nobody understands or cares about
         me."</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         tertiary function then has an interesting role. Usually, we
         use it to add richness to our lives, by focussing on things
         we usually overlook. But when we're trying to avoid the
         messages from the inferior, we use the tertiary to help us
         fight or run from those messages. Thus, for the INTP, the
         tertiary function Si keeps us focussed on our inner world,
         and convinces us even further that no one can understand our
         unique inner world, or appreciate us.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">When
         we use the auxiliary function to try to restore the balance,
         however, the tertiary function can take on yet another role.
         When the INTP uses Ne to see herself as an element to be
         considered, she notes that what she does effects how others
         perceive her and interact with her, and modify her behavior
         accordingly. She can then use Si, or her own unique inner
         picture of the world, to identify when she has reached the
         limits to her accommodation to the outside world.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         tertiary dynamic then is this:</font><br>
         <font size="-1">When our outer and inner worlds are in
         balance, it provides more richness in our life by focussing
         on what we often overlook. When they are not, it colludes
         with the dominant function to try to fight or run away from
         the message the inferior is sending us. But when we use our
         auxiliary function to restore the inner/outer balance, the
         tertiary function provides a check, letting us know when we
         have reached our limits.</font></p>

         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Interestingly
         enough, the first school would discourage SPs, and noted
         that NPs didn't do as well in their program. Yet according
         to type theory, it is the SPs and NPs that would be best at
         three-dimensional thinking. Can't win for losing.</font></p>
         
         <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b><i>Feedback
         question:</i></b></font><font color="#000000" size="-1">&nbsp;<br>
         </font><font size="-1"><b>How has knowledge of type affected
         your own career path? Or how do you think it should be used
         in job counselling? </b></font><br>
         <font size="-1"><b>INTP</b></font><br>
         <font size="-1">The examples you cited illustrate well why I
         have severe reservations about it. I am a believer in
         unorthodox choices and personal growth in less natural
         preferences. Personally the knowledge about type has helped
         me to understand why I have been drawn to different roles,
         subjects and occupations. It all makes more sense and now I
         can be more clear about what I want to do and where I want
         to go. However, if I had known as an 18-years-old that I was
         INTP and immediately applied for computer science or law, I
         would have missed so much valuable experience.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I'm
         so strong N that I'm almost deficient in anything concrete.
         However, I spent 5 years of my life as a roulette/black jack
         dealer and eventually became very good in it. It was so
         satisfying to see that I CAN learn something where you have
         to use your hands and notice immediate realities. It may
         take more time than many others have to spend but in the end
         I can become just as skilled as them. This knowledge has
         given me confidence to tackle other stuff (like, driving
         car, using different kind of machines, learning to dance)
         where I used to think I'm hopeless.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Also
         I spent some time as communications professional and
         journalist, which is more of a people job. While I found
         myself avoiding face-to-face interactions and learning about
         technology in unnecessary depth, I still got to practice
         being with people and taking them into account. Now I am a
         happy systems engineer, but wouldn't change anything about
         my professional history.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">People
         shouldn't let their type discourage them from trying
         challenging stuff. There are many professions where both
         polarities can be as necessary (for example, I think in S/N
         are equally valuable in designing systems). Also, people can
         and do enjoy jobs traditionally recommended to some other
         type (I know many NFs who are happy working with technology
         - they often have kind of vision for what to use it
         for).</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><b>INFP</b></font><br>
         <font size="-1">I'm an INFP and 19 years old and am in limbo
         on deciding what to do (aren't we all?). Whereas a Sensor
         might be overwhelmed by the possibilities of what field to
         go to, there are very few careers out there that would let
         me utilize my type to the fullest extent. There's not too
         many other jobs besides artist, counseler/psychologist, or
         religious worker that are recommended for INFPs. Ultimately,
         I think it is totally absurd, getting a career and all. It
         makes me feel like a cog in a machine, having to do a
         specific task for the good of society. Even if it is
         inspiring work which I love, I would still be chained to my
         mandated existence. So, I guess the only thing my type has
         taught me about career choice is whichever I choose I'm
         submitting myself to becoming a robot.</font></p>
