         is an on-line game to determine type. You are a newly minted
         android trying to determine who you are. On a series of
         screens, you are placed in various social situations where
         you have to make choices. Each page takes a while to load,
         and there are not enough pages and choices to do a really
         good job of determining your type, only about two questions
         per type dichotomy. Although I'm an INTP, I came out as INFJ
         and INFP: not surprising since those are the two preferences
         where my preference is less clear. Still, it's a wonderful
         concept. With more situations and faster download time, it
         could be a great way to determine type.</font>&nbsp;</p>

         There is forum dedicated to Jung's psychology (the person
         who came up with the concept of types), but I could find
         little there dealing with personality type. The

         online tests, but I thought the questions were better
         written. Instead of asking generally which you prefer
         (although the test includes some of that kind of question),
         there are a lot of questions which give you specific
         situations to answer.</font></p>

         Personality Profiler™, which may be taken online for a
         fee of $29.95 as of 15 Sep 1999. This profiler is not the
         MBTI® instrument: "Using Jung's Type Theory as a
         foundation, the Personality Profiler unites Psychological
         Type, Temperament, Trait, and the Five-Factor Model of
         Personality into a comprehensive survey and Feedback
         Report." You will get a four letter type, where the J/P
         preference has been replaced by Z/A, with certain changes in
         the understanding of what that preference means. Also, each
         preference pair is further broken down into "facets". For
         example, T-F facets include Rational-Empathetic,
         Autonomous-Compassionate, Analytic-Warm and
         Competitive-Nurturing. Thus it is possible for someone with
         a strong T preference to still have a score for the
         Nurturing facet - or for someone with an F preference to
         have a high score for the Analytic
         facet.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</p>

         given me feedback on this site, and recommends it,
         especially if you have had problems determining your type in
         the past. Interestingly, his problem was in differentiating
         N vs S. Others seem to think other Myers-Briggs™

         interesting to see if this test avoids that. This page is
