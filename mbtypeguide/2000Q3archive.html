         <b><i>What Will I Do With My Money?: How Your Personality
         Affects Your Financial Behavior</i></b>, by Ray Linder
         </font><a href="books.html"><font size="-1">Click here for
         more info on this or other books</font></a><font size="-1">
         Back on July 12, I did a link review about Ray Linder's Good
         Stewardship site and money personality (see </font><a href="etc.html#RayLinder"><font size="-1">Net
         Links &gt; etc.</font></a><font size="-1">). He got in touch
         with me, and asked if he could send me this book. I agreed,
         and after reading it decided to do a book review.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">In
         the type community, we constantly say there is more to any
         given discussion of people than just personality type.
         <b><i>What Will I Do With My Money?</i></b> takes that
         admonition seriously. How we feel about money and what we do
         with it depends on more than type, and Linder spends the
         first section of his book, called The Meaning of Money,
         talking about those other factors.</font>
         <font size="-1">What are proud of in our handling of money,
         and what makes us ashamed? What motivates us in spending
         money - financial gain, comfort, or something else? What are
         our values? When we continually spend money in ways that are
         not in accord with our values, it causes stress. Linder
         talks about money memories, financial pathologies, and what
         contributes to self esteem. He doesn't mention personality
         until he gets to the five factors that affect our self
         esteem. Innate personality is one of them - the other four
         are family of origin, faith, peer group and society.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">The
         second section is an introdution to personality type. In
         addition to the usual description of functions, types, and
         temperaments, he introduces his own terms for financial
         temperament. In relation to money, SJs are protectors, SPs
         are players, NFs are pleasers, and NTs are planners.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">In
         the third and last section, Mind over Money, Linder goes
         over the implications of personality type, temperament and
         dominant function on the many issues related to money
         matters. He introduces his Golden Rule of personal finance:
         "<i>Your goal in personal money management is to orient your
         life around the fulfillment of the material things that
         matter most</i>." In a sense, the whole book is full of
         information and exercises to help you become aware of just
         how to do that it your own life. </font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">On September 16, 1998, this site debuted
         with my first and only two features week: </font><a href="1998archive.html#09141998logical"><font size="-1">It's
         Only Logical</font></a><font size="-1"> and </font><a href="1998archive.html#09141998statistics"><font size="-1">Statistics</font></a><font size="-1">.
         Since then, I've posted 96 feature articles, most of them
         written by me. </font><font color="#000000" size="-1">Two
         years ago, I saw this site as a guide to web sites about
         Myers-Briggs topics, and that hasn't changed. However, in
         the meantime, internet jargon might have referred to this
         site variously as an ezine, a weblog, and most recently, a
         vortal (vertical portal).</font><font size="-1"><br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font color="#000000" size="-1">A
         year ago, I was getting about 100 unique visitors a day,
         most of whom found me in the search engines, when they
         searched for Myers-Briggs. Today, I get 250 to 300 unique
         visitors a day, and about 60% still come through the search
         engines by searching on Myers Briggs or a four letter type.
         The top three search engines used to find this site were
         AOL.com search, MSN and Google, with Yahoo! coming in
         fourth. Last year, about 10 - 20% of you appeared to be
         regulars, and this year it looks like about 20%. An
         additional 20% of you followed links from another site.

         this year is the free subscription email newsletter of my
         This Week, which includes an archive of past issues.
         I&nbsp;have 300 subscribers, and my information about
         visitor types comes mostly from my subscriber
         poll.</font><font size="-1">
         </font><font color="#000000" size="-1">A year ago, most of
         you identified yourselves to me as preferring N in my site
         polls, but there was a sizable chunk of visitors that prefer
         S.</font><font size="-1"> This year's subscriber polling
         shows that the N preference outnumbers the S preference 6 to
         1, and introverts outnumber extraverts 4 to 1. You are
         pretty evenly divided between the T and F preferences, and
         between the J and P preferences.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         format of the site hasn't changed much.
         </font><font size="-1">I still provide four or five reviewed
         links every week, including one specifically relating to one
         of the sixteen types - my Focus on Type review. New this
         year is my top paragraph of This Week, which lets you know
         about new Net Link categories, non-profit conference, or
         other news. I've added a </font><a href="FAQ.html"><font size="-1">Frequently
         Asked Questions</font></a><font size="-1"> page and three
         new Net Link categories:&nbsp;</font><a href="nonenglish.html"><font size="-1">nonEnglish

         I still provide one original article every week, usually by
         me, but sometimes I get someone else to do it. Any more
         volunteers out there?&nbsp;<br>

         year I&nbsp;added feedback forms all over the site.
         Sometimes an entire week's edition is based solely on the
         feedback forms you sent me. So keep them coming! Two of you
         have suggested some sort of MBTI related bulletin board
         associated with this site. I'm considering it.<br>

         year I added the Amazon associate links, and the income
         provided now pays for my ISP and site hosting fees (and a
         salary of about 10 cents an hour). I've been playing around
         with other associate programs, but so far I haven't hit on
         anything else that has worked as well (although I&nbsp;have
         high hopes for </font><a href="MYSSFeature.html"><font size="-1">Make
         Your Site Sell</font></a><font size="-1">). I'm still trying
         to find a way to make this site pay for the time and money I
         invest in it. Any suggestions are appreciated.<br>

         know this site looks cluttered, and can be hard to navigate.
         Someday, I hope to publish the link reviews from my own
         database, so you can put together web pages of link reviews
         based on your search criteria.<br>

         year I've been taking on more web design work, so I will
         probably cut down the frequency of my editions from once a
         week to twice a month, or maybe just once a month. I do
         absolutely all the work to keep this site up, from
         researching the links I review, to writing or finding
         feature articles, to writing html and configuring forms.
         Each weekly edition takes me from 5 to 10 hours to put
         together.<br>

         I move into my third year on the web, I look forward to
         hearing from you. As I said in my report last year, you know
         I listen, and your comments may lead me to make a change to

         <p><font size="-1">When Jean Kummerow spoke at Susan's
         funeral she described her as having <i>"...an intense
         vibrant curiosity, every second, every hour, every day - she
         was always asking probing questions, and always
         learning..."</i> This is a description which most of us
         would cherish and Susan certainly earned.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">I
         met Susan some eight or nine years ago, when she was running
         a master class on 'using type in communication', in Oxford
         (UK). I was taken by her enthusiasm professionalism and
         humour. One of the greatest things she taught me right away
         - both of us having an ENTP preference - was that it was OK
         to be myself in training. I simply had to watch her interact
         with the group. I had recently qualified in the MBTI and was
         using it for a dissertation, for my Masters degree in Adult
         Education. I was in the process of soaking up as much
         information about type as possible.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">As
         many of you will know, Susan had been involved with the MBTI
         for almost the whole of her working life. She was the second
         president of APT and gained awards for her work with the
         MBTI. She believed passionately in using type in a practical
         way - but a way grounded in research. She combined an
         apparent lightness of touch - mainly through humour - with a
         rigorous approach to theory. When teaching she had antennae
         poised for every teaching point - whether it be to recognise
         and reinforce positive points made or point out examples of
         biased or negative use of type.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">As
         I listened to Susan teaching her FLEX Talk model, I was
         immediately taken with the idea of converting it into health
         care. We communicated for some time and then I met her twice
         back in Oxford where she "grilled" me about my ideas. She
         would often demonstrate to groups "<i>what interest looks
         like in a thinking type</i>" and I certainly experienced
         that and respected her for it.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">We
         decided to go the whole distance - to write a book about
         type and health care - and developed a proposal together. By
         now I knew that Susan had cancer and we talked about how she
         would feel, writing about the very illness from which she
         suffered. When we were offered a contract, she was very ill
         indeed and offered to withdraw. I asked if she would go
         ahead - me drafting and collecting data, while she edited.
         She agreed and this was ideal.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">I
         learnt so much from Susan's edits and enjoyed seeing my work
         continuously improved. She was aware that, as two ENTPs, we
         could have the same blind spots. But she could spot me
         writing from my own type - as in, for example, "<i>...you
         have described 'I' as being 'not E'...</i>".<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">We
         of course had similar senses of humour. Whilst I continued
         to be sensitive to the 'her illness/our work' connection, I
         relaxed when I tentatively sent a piece of what I thought
         was amusing writing by a cancer sufferer. She
         characteristically noted on the margin "<i>Judy, I am
         snorting with laughter reading this!</i>"<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">At
         no time did Susan directly use her own illness in our work -
         she managed to keep them separate, in an amazing way. When
         we prepared to present our material, and write papers for
         conferences, her academic rigour surfaced once more. As I
         have written elsewhere, second best would not do (many times
         I may have wished it might!). Presenting with her was fun -
         and interesting - as she became so wrapped up in her piece
         that time became of no moment.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">I
         had not considered how closely one works with someone when
         co-authoring. I shiver to think of what might have been and
         how fortunate we were that it worked so well. Susan's
         illness was always present but she rarely complained - she
         saw it as part of her life. As Jean Kummerow said: "<i>she
         saw it as something to be learned about, managed and lived
         with</i>".<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">When
         Susan developed further problems in spring of this year, the
         outlook was bleak. I was pleased that I could go and stay
         with her, and take early copies of the book over to her. On
         that visit we also ran a pilot training course for health
         care students. None of them knew she was ill, but she was
         having daily treatment at that time and died two and a half
         weeks later. She even talked to me, on the phone, about the
         way her carers communicated with her during her last days,
         as well as checking up on what I was doing!<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Susan
         had always planned to live, and I am sure that is why she
         outlasted the most optimistic forecasts. She touched the
         lives of many who, like me, have reason to be grateful for
         her wisdom and generosity.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">We
         argued constantly over who should be the first author - the
         publishers saying it was unheard of to have two authors both
         wanting the other to go first! In the end, she won - saying
         prophetically that I was the Mother, she the midwife.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Whilst
         I have written of my own experience I know many people could
         write similarly. In the wider sense our partnership reflects
         one of the many gifts of the MBTI. It introduced us in the

         <p><font size="-1">The last feedback question in July simply
         asked what was on your mind. I got only one response, but it
         was so interesting I thought I'd share it with you and get
         your help. The anonymous ENTJ writes:</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1"><i>I am totally stuck in my
            career. Something must be awry because although I come
            across quite typically for my type i.e. I am perceived as
            a natural leader with high persuasive skill (my way of
            being directive I think:)) and a great 'story teller' I
            have not yet been able to get a real position of
            leadership in the companies I work in. The 'real' leaders
            use me to rally the troops, troubleshoot stuff, sell and
            champion ideas but I want to be the 'real' leader with
            the money and title etc. I want to know where I am stuck
            and would like to use some understanding of my type and
            how it interacts with other types to help analyze the
            problem. Any suggestions?</i></font></blockquote>
         
         <p><font size="-1">This question brings up a delicate point.
         While it is good to focus on the positive attributes of each
         type, type theory also implies that each type will also have
         blind spots and weak areas. One site I have reviewed
         discusses how type can affect miscommunication. Check out my
         link review in </font><a href="etc.html#AchillesTendencies"><font size="-1">Net
         Links &gt; etc : Achilles Tendencies: Exploring Human
         Frailty and Personality Type</font></a><font size="-1">. He
         mentions that one of the defensive Satir modes that may be
         more likely for TJ's is the blaming mode.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">A
         very practical book that discusses the impact of type on
         leadership style, including weaknesses and blind spots is:
         Hardwired Leadership by Roger R. Pearman. For more info on
         the book, as well as a link to my book review, go to

         Links &gt; books : Hardwired
         Leadership</font></a><font size="-1">. There is a
         fascinating chart in the book that lists what leadership
         qualities each type sees in themselves, which of those
         qualities are also seen by observers, and which qualities
         are not seen by observers (blind spots). Leadership
         qualities not seen by observers of ENTJ's are <i>"teamwork,
         developing relationships, being self-aware, being free of
         interpersonal difficulty, commitment to management's
         vision."</i> The book also goes through communication
         styles, preconceptions, hot buttons and more for each
         type.<br>

         there's the usual caveat: type doesn't explain everything.
         There may be something totally unrelated to type that is
         keeping this ENTJ from the position he or she wants.

         Starting in June 2000, MyComputer.com started keeping track
         of unique monthly visitors to this site (before that, I
         could see unique visitors per day - so someone who visited
         on several different days would be counted as unique for
         each day, but would show several times in a month). In June
         there were over 4700 unique visitors, in July, over 6700
         unique visitors, in August so far there have been over 7300.
         Looks like the number of unique visitors is going up, even
         though the (northern hemisphere) summer months are supposed
         to be the slowest on the web. Unique visitors per day in
         August have ranged from a low of 166 to a high of 367.
         Increase in traffic has been consistent but not dramatic

         There are 284 subscribers to the email newsletter version of
         this site. Although this site was first published on
         September 16, 1998, the newsletter didn't start until
         November 11, 1999. According to the current poll running
         among newsletter subscribers (63 responses or 22% response
         rate), the most common subscriber type is INTP, closely
         followed by INFP and INFJ. The most common "S" types are
         ISTJ and ISFJ. The NF temperament is most common, followed
         by the NT temperament and the SJ temperament, with the SP
         temperament being the lowest. No subscribers with the ISFP,
         ISTP and ESFJ types have participated in the poll.
         Subscribers are pretty evenly divided between T and F, with
         slightly more preferring F. Those with the N preference
         outnumber those with the S preference roughly 6 to 1.
         Introverts outnumber Extraverts roughly 4 to 1. There is a
         definite but small preference for P over J. So the
         "composite type" of newletter subscribers that have
         participated in the poll so far is INFP.</font>&nbsp;</p>

         used to identify a company's products and/or services and
         differentiate them from those offered by other companies.
         Trademarks are valuable assets. Customers expect a certain
         standard of quality from a company's products and/or
         services based on recognition of its trademarks.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">In order to protect its valuable
         trademark assets, Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. (CPP)
         has adopted the following guidelines, which must be adhered
         to by all persons and entities using CPP's trademarks. In
         addition we enclose a list of CPP's trademarks. If you have
         any trademark questions or are uncertain about the proper

         <p><font size="-1">The key to trademark protection is to
         ensure that the public always recognizes a particular word

         SYMBOLS</b></font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">The circle-R symbol (®) identifies a
         trademark that has been formally registered by the U.S.
         Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). It is used when the mark
         identifies the products or services for which the mark has
         been registered. The ® symbol is usually placed in the
         upper right-hand corner of the trademark.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">The TM symbol (™) identifies a
         trademark that has not been formally registered by the PTO.
         It is used when a mark identifies products or services with
         which the mark is used but for which the PTO has not yet
         granted registration. The ™ symbol is usually placed in
         the upper right-hand corner of the trademark.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">If you are uncertain as to which symbol
         should be used, do not hesitate to contact the Legal
         Department at CPP.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><b>ALWAYS USE A TRADEMARK AS AN
         ADJECTIVE</b></font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">Always use a trademark as an adjective,
         NEVER as a noun or a verb. The value of a trademark is that
         it associates a product with the owners of that products.
         Where a trademark becomes commonly used as a noun, the
         association between the product and its source is lost.
         Therefore, a trademark should always be used as an
         adjective.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">As a rule of thumb, the sentence should
         be complete even if the word or symbol that is the trademark

         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Gryffindor
         is the house Harry and his friends end up in. Its symbol is
         the Lion. Dumbledore, the headmaster of the school was in
         this house, as well as Harry's father. Gryffindor is for the
         brave at heart, who have daring, nerve and
         chivalry.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         think Gryffindor corresponds to the SP or artisan
         temperament. According to Please Understand Me II,
         "<i>Artisans see themselves, and wish to be seen by others,
         as bold, daring, venturesome - audacious</i>."</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Hufflepuff
         has the badger for its symbol. None of Harry's friends or
         enemies end up in this one. In conversations among the
         incoming first year students, the only comment anyone makes
         about Hufflepuff is that they don't want to end up there.
         Hufflepuff is for the just and the loyal, who are not afraid
         of hard work.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         think Hufflepuff corresponds to the SJ or guardian
         temperament. Guardians wish to "<i>present themselves as
         dependable, trustworthy, or accountable in shouldering their
         responsibilities.</i>"</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         next two houses, Ravenclaw and Slytherin, correspond to NF
         and NT, although I'm not completely convinced which is
         which.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Ravenclaw
         is considered by characters to be an acceptable second
         choice to Gryffindor by Harry's friend Hermione. Its symbol
         is the eagle. None of Harry's friends or enemies end up in
         this one. Ravenclaw is for the wise, who have wit and
         learning. This could fit the NT or rational temperament,
         which seeks for knowledge, or the NF temperament which
         aspires to be a sage.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Slytherin
         is the house where most, if not all, of Harry's enemies are
         (for students) or were (for adults). Its symbol is the
         snake. Slytherin is for the cunning, who will use any means
         to achieve their ends. The problem with determining the
         temperament represented by this house is that in the first
         book, at least, there are no positive examples from this
         house. In determining the temperament, I have to look at the
         negative aspects of the NF and NT temperaments. The traits
         shown by the enemies seem to me to be mostly power lust, and
         the NT thirst for competency, gone astray, could take that
         form, I think.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">So
         my final list: Gryffindor - SP, Hufflepuff - SJ, Ravenclaw -
         NF, Slytherin - NT. Although the houses are sorted by
         temperament, I don't think that the temperament of each
         character matches the temperament I assign to the house.
         Dumbledore is from SP Gryffindor, but I'm pretty sure he's
         NT. </font></p>

         be constantly focused on all the details in your
         environment. This is extraverted S, not introverted S, where
         you are continually comparing the external data with your

         look at Ti, with extroverted perception, whether N or S.
         Extraverted N would focus on patterns as input, extraverted
         S would focus on the facts, as input. In either case, Ti is
         logical and impersonal but makes decisions "<i>based on
         probabilities</i>" and "<i>leaves room for the
         unexpected.</i>" Introverted thinking coordinates our
         "<i>behaviors logically with immediate sensory data</i>" or
         in the case of Ne, with immediate patterns. (Quotes from

         ISTP's are naturals, INTP's have to work hard at it. Doesn't
         sound like Sherlock worked constantly on his boxing. Also,
         violin playing would fit in&nbsp; more with ISTP's love of

         <p><font size="-1"><b>Junkie</b><br>
         Remember in Sherlock's world, opium was not illegal. It was
         just like any other addictive vice: tobacco or alcohol. If
         Sherlock were "alive" today, he certainly wouldn't be a
         junkie, because of the loss of control caused by addiction
         to an illegal substance, especially since his passion was
         solving crimes.&nbsp;</font><br>

         <b><i>Lessons from the Window Seat, Achieving Shared Vision
         in the Workplace </i></b>by David Specht, forward by Linda
         Berens. Back on June 7 I did a link review referencing
         Specht's article on employee retention (see </font><a href="business.html#specht"><font size="-1">Net
         Links &gt; business</font></a><font size="-1">). He got in
         touch with me, and asked if he could send me this book. I
         agreed, and after reading it decided to do a book
         review.</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">This book is written as the story of a
         fictional manager who is no longer satisfied at work. Bob
         Sippel is frustrated by his situation at work after budget
         cuts at work leave him as the only remaining project manager
         in R &amp; D. His wife asks him where he wants to be in the
         next five years and what he needs from his company. Bob
         reflects on the answers, notices concrete examples around
         him, and discusses them with colleagues. In the process, Bob
         discovers that before he can align his vision with his
         company's, he has to first know both his own vision and his
         company's.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Part
         of the story, of course, deals with type, or more
         accurately, temperament. Specht's method of helping you
         determine your temperament uses a somewhat different method
         than I've seen elsewhere. Instead of a list of questions, he
         asks you to read the needs and values for each temperament,
         circling those that are most important to you. Then at the
         bottom of the page, there are blank lines where you are to
         note down where in your life you meet these needs and
         values. You do this for <i>each</i> temperament. Presumably,
         you can then go back and identify your temperament by
         finding the temperament where you made the most circles.
         This also has the very positive side effect of stressing
         that whatever your temperament is, you still have aspects of
         the other temperaments.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">By
         using the story format, Specht is able to provide gentle
         criticism of things that do not contribute to shared vision
         without pointing fingers. However, the examples are concrete
         enough (differing levels of customer service during Sippel's
         plane ride) to clearly illustrate his points.<br>
         </font><font size="-2"><img src="2000Q3archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25"></font><font size="-1">Another
         interesting aspect of this book is that the protagonist is a
         Guardian (SJ) who has changed jobs several times. Another
         character is an Artisan (SP) who has never changed jobs at
         all. Although that seems to go against what we think of the
         SP and SJ temperaments, it points out that an SP who finds
         sufficient change and challenge on the job may stay in one
         job for a long time, while even an SJ may find himself
         changing jobs if he doesn't find one that meets his core
         needs. </font></p>
