         <font size="-1">This book, written from the Christian
         tradition, describes four methods of prayer that correlate
         to the four types: Ignatian prayer - SJ, Augustinian prayer

         According to the authors, the NT prayer form was imposed on
         clergy until fairly recently, and although they try to avoid
         it, in my opinion there is still an obvious bias against the
         NT prayer form in the book.</font>&nbsp;<br>

<p><font color="#ffcc00"><b>Superstats is the free statistics service
I&nbsp;use for this site. It tells me how many of you visited, which
pages, how long you stayed, and more. And now, they've started to pay
me when you click on the part of the banner that goes to their site.
Imagine that - free stats AND money per click through!</b></font></p>
