         variety of interests. I bet you are no exception. Most of
         you will probably be visiting this site for the first time,
         probably the vast majority, and the rest of you will have
         found it because of a focused search. Some of you may never
         return again, and others will be delighted again and again.
         Such is the world of the Internet.&nbsp;</font><br>

         brief article about the free download game,
         SpaceColonyH”.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         game is a psychologically-based, problem-solving leadership
         game set in space. It is non-violent, non-racist and
         non-sexist.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Decisions
         and decision making are the focus for what follows in this
         article, especially as it relates to personality: yours and
         mine. You can tell a lot about personalities by watching
         gestures. Definitive or soft, stabbing or encompassing,
         gestures reveal the inner world of people. They express
         themselves without being consciously aware of doing it.
         Really watch people… but then you probably already are
         if you are visiting this site.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Hippocrates,
         the father of modern medicine, 2500 years ago categorized
         people into four main groups. Undoubtedly the names:
         Choleric, Sanguine, Melancholic and Phlegmatic mean little
         to you. Therefore, these names/categories have been
         modernized to be, respectively, the: Formal Leader, Informal
         Leader, Planner and Peacemaker. Fifteen people, eight women
         and seven men, were photographed gesturing in the four
         gestures representing the four personality types as
         described in my site. You will need look closely in order to
         ‘name’ the personality in each game
         turn.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Decisions
         also have other influences: time and resources, being but
         two. When time is short, urgent perhaps two
         ‘decisive’ types will emerge and are needed:
         Formal Leaders and Informal Leaders. When circumspection and
         consensus building are suitable: Planners and Peacemakers
         come to the fore. Either set of two is appropriate when the
         timeliness for their types of decision is of greatest
         influence.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Resources
         drive decisions as well. If supplies run short, do you take
         from others so that ‘production’ can continue
         unabated? Or do you ensure that everyone’s supply is
         protected no matter the consequences? If more people are
         needed for an urgent task, do you require people to put in
         heavy overtime, with little or no compensation, or do
         you&nbsp;<br>
         conclude that a ‘lesser resolution’ is
         acceptable?&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">These
         then are some of the considerations of the game:
         SpaceColonyH”. Each game has nine turns where the
         personality of the problem-reporting colonist has to be
         chosen and an operational decision has to be made. If you
         choose well, you will be ‘voted’ as Permanent
         Executive Director; if not, you are invited to try again. In
         fact, since the game is free, you are welcome to play again
         and again. There are almost 6000 game players
         worldwide.&nbsp;</font><br>

         mechanics of a review page where your answers will be
         compared with the ‘most correct choices’. So, try

         bookstore, because it might give him more ideas. The INTP

         reading</i>.</b></font><font size="-1"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">Let's say you are in a bookstore, o.k.?
         Let's then say you are in the Sciences section. Are you
         still with me?&nbsp; O.k.!&nbsp; You're in a bookstore, you
         are browsing the science section, you're leafing through a
         book. At some&nbsp;point, another "person" wanders into the
         very same section as you, and it's a very small, cramped
         section. O.k.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Let's
         begin with the assumption that you are an ENTP.&nbsp; The
         other "person" ambles into your, heretofore exclusively
         occupied, space. You glance up from your leafing, look
         towards the other person.&nbsp; (This is where it gets a
         liiiiittle dicey.) As an ENTP, you look towards their eyes.
         If they are looking for your eyes, you make brief eye
         contact, nod your head (only slightly), and make a feeble
         attempt at a smile (no teeth). Then, you make a gesture of
         movement (slight) to acquiesce a little of your space to the
         newcomer and say something like "Hi!"; "How are you?"; then
         go back to the leafing.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">However,
         if the other person makes no attempt at eye contact, you
         keep leafing and make no further gestures nor acquiesce any
         space until such time as the newcomer makes it obvious that
         they need to "get at" the space in your immediate vicinity.
         Then, you make another attempt at eye contact. If they
         engage, you send out a small talk salvo such as, "Excuse
         me."; or "Pardon me."; or "Are you trying to get here?";
         while making a slight movement to give ground. If this
         person responds in kind (i.e. "Thank you."; "Pardon ME!"; .
         . . ) you make another innocuous comment that could
         potentially start a conversation, but, doesn't sound like a
         come on if the other person does not take the next step.
         Depending, of course, on the reaction of the other person,
         it is very likely that you will engage in some type of
         discussion with that person.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">O.K.?&nbsp;
         So, now you're wearing an INTP hat, and the same scenario
         occurs. As soon as the other "person" enters the outer
         periphery of your comfort zone (about 10 to 11 feet) you
         move, as if you had already made the decision 5 minutes
         prior, to a new location and quickly set up a new comfort
         zone.&nbsp;</font></p>

         Briggs Myers (yes, she of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®
         fame) is a mystery that won a contest over an Ellery Queen

         Jerningham, a playwright who writes and produces hit mystery
         plays, tries to figure out who murdered a millionaire, and
         the terrible secret of the millionaire's grand-niece, that
         she would rather die than tell. He is helped by two friends:
         his faithful secretary Mac, and his old buddy Carl Nilsson
         from Jerningham's time with Marines, who is now a homicide
         detective. There are no "tricks" in this mystery. If you are
         observant, you can figure out the mystery yourself, although
         I didn't. I was surprised at the ending, but it was the only
         ending that fit. In fact, I immediately reread the book,
         knowing how the murder was done and who did it, to see how
         it all fit together.&nbsp;</font><br>

         mysteries, read this book. If you're just interested in
         type, you might want to read it just to figure out the types
         of the characters. Check it out from the library if you can

         <p><font size="-1">In a previous articles, I have described
         how I saw my own INTP type (</font><a href="1999Q1archive.html#03181999InsideMyHeadINTPINFP"><font size="-1">Inside

         Unicorn Type - ISFJ</font></a><font size="-1">). In this
         article, I'll describe how I see the ISTJ type. Like the
         ISFJ, the dominant function of an ISTJ is introverted
         sensing. The auxiliary function is extraverted thinking. For
         some reason, I think this description works best in the
         first person.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1">=====================</font><br>
         <font size="-1">I live in my inner world, which is detailed,
         with color, sound, taste, touch and smell. What I remember I
         can bring up in full detail, like virtual reality with taste
         and smell thrown in. In fact, with more detail than virtual
         reality.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         use objective logic when I have to leave my inner world and
         deal with the outside world. I look something over,
         determine what category it is in, and how it relates to my
         goals, and then, if appropriate, let it into my inner world.
         A lot of the time, I just use judgement to shorten my
         interaction with the outside world so I can go back to my
         inner world.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">People
         think I notice everything. When I look at a thing in the
         real world, I can instantly compare it with the many
         detailed versions I am constantly around in my inner world.
         That's why it's so easy for me to instantly spot anything
         different or out of the ordinary - or something that hasn't
         been cleaned or maintained correctly. I'm not necessarily
         <b>looking</b> for an error: it's almost like I can
         superimpose the thing I'm looking at over my inner image and
         see the differences.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">When
         I want to remember something, such as the name of a
         restaurant, I automatically add it to my inner world. I
         determine the details that are logically related to the
         restaurant, and add them. That means I don't just add the
         name of the restaurant, but its location, the kind of food
         they serve there, maybe the owner or maitre d', the part of
         town it's in, or whatever details I think are relevant. Once
         I've built up a complete picture of the restaurant in my
         inner world, it's almost impossible for me to lose
         it.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Sometimes
         I irritate people because you can't just tell me the "name"
         of a restaurant. I want to know a lot more than that. As
         I've gotten older, I've learned to judge when to ask people
         for all the gritty details, and when to just look it up for
         myself. The result of this is that I never forget something
         if I've actually been given the time to plan it. Once I plan
         it, it's part of me. I could no more forget it than my
         head.</font><br>

         <p><font size="-1"><b><i>Before [I found out I was an
         ISTJ] I was a number one [on the Enneagram]. I
         have been studying the enneagram for more than three years
         now. Just recently I went back to college, and learned
         of&nbsp; "Myers and Briggs," and I can tell you, I have been
         fighting perfectionism my whole life. With the help of the
         enneagram, and more than likely age, I am finally learning
         to calm down. But, one thing puzzles me about my type, that
         makes me sometimes wonder if I am a ISTJ at all is, I do not
         like being like everybody else, I go out of my way to be
         different. Also, I really do not care about belonging to any
         group, I am mostly a loner. Also, I obsess on anything that
         catches my attention, I have to know everything there is to
         know about the subject. If you have any insight into this,
         it would be appreciated. Maybe you know of other ISTJs that

         man, who is sort of riding herd on everything --including my
         project-- is evidently an ES. He insists on bringing in more
         and more people to "help" me. We are working with very short
         deadlines and more people make it harder. On top of that, he
         continually schedules brain-storming sessions with various
         people (including the big boss) to help us think through
         good ideas. I keep trying to convince him that we understand
         the ideas to be included in the vision statement; we just
         need to be LEFT ALONE for awhile to write the damned thing!
         This is a classic conflict. The difference is, I understand
         his preference, but he doesn't hold much faith in MBTI or
         any such "hokey nonsense."</font></p>

         be constantly focused on all the details in your
         environment. This is extraverted S, not introverted S, where
         you are continually comparing the external data with your

         look at Ti, with extroverted perception, whether N or S.
         Extraverted N would focus on patterns as input, extraverted
         S would focus on the facts, as input. In either case, Ti is
         logical and impersonal but makes decisions "based on
         probabilities" and "leaves room for the unexpected."
         Introverted thinking coordinates our "behaviors logically
         with immediate sensory data" or in the case of Ne, with
         immediate patterns. (Quotes from Lenore Thomson's

         ISTP's are naturals, INTP's have to work hard at it. Doesn't

         violin playing would fit in&nbsp; more with ISTP's love of

         <p><font size="-1"><b>Junkie</b><br>
         Remember in Sherlock's world, opium was not illegal. It was
         just like any other addictive vice: tobacco or alcohol. If
         Sherlock were "alive" today, he certainly wouldn't be a
         junkie, because of the loss of control caused by addiction
         to an illegal substance, especially since his passion was

         <p><font size="-1">So what's the use of knowing type?
         Especially if you have trouble determining someone else's
         type anyway? Here's how I use it.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">First
         of all, although I have trouble figuring a person's whole
         type, I am usually able to figure out one or two functions.
         Then, when I communicate with that person, I take the
         function or functions into account. For example, if I'm
         working with someone I think prefers S, I will make a point
         to be more concrete and factual than I otherwise might be.
         If I'm right about the function preference, my communication
         with that person improves. If it doesn't improve, I pick
         another function and try again.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Do
         you have to be "good" at the preference you're communicating
         with? You have to understand it well enough to use it, but
         you don't have to be an expert. Believe me, the people who
         truly have a strong preference for S will notice you're not
         &lt;grin&gt; and the same goes for the other function
         preferences. But most people will appreciate your effort to
         "speak their language".&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">By
         the way, Dick Thompson likens communication between people
         with different function preferences to speaking different
         languages, and has developed a <i>Communication Wheel
         (tm)</i>. Check out my link review of his company, High

         <p><font size="-1">Lenore Thomson has written a book that
         includes the best descriptions of what the functions mean of
         any book I have read. I think I finally understand how F
         judgment works. Also a lot of fun is how she includes
         examples from the Star Trek universe of shows to illustrate
         various functions. It's amazing how well this works: Star
         Trek aliens can often embody pure types or missing type
         functions in a way that real human beings
         can't.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q2archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Although
         the book is fun, and accessible, she can get quite complex.
         She describes how each type uses all four functions, T, F, S
         and N in each attitude. Thus, for an INTP, besides my
         dominant Ti, auxiliary Ne, tertiary Si and inferior Fe, she
         also describes how I use my "crow's nest" functions (Fi and
         Se) and my "double agent" functions (Te and Ni). If that's
         too much alphabet soup, don't worry. The in-depth
         descriptions of each dominant function and the Star Trek
         examples are quite accessible, and you can get to the rest
         later, if you want to.&nbsp;</font><br>

         on brain type, locating each dominant function in different
         areas of the brain. Extroverted T and F, and introverted S
         and N are in the "linear" left hemisphere, while extroverted
         S and N and introverted T and F are in the "holistic" right
         hemisphere. Her descriptions of the difference between
         extroverted F, which is linear, and introverted F, which is
         holistic, was fascinating, since I had always imagined F to
         be holistic. Also, T is not always linear - extroverted T
         is, but not introverted T.&nbsp;</font><br>
