         This is one of the most popular areas of this site. Although
         many people call them tests, they're not really - since
         there are no right or wrong answers. Yes, you can find the
         official MBTI® instrument on the internet, but not for
         free. Here you can find link reviews of five sites that
         provide the MBTI® instrument online, 17 sites that
         provide free sorters based on the MBTI® instrument, and
         four sites that provide sorters based on the MBTI®
         instrument that are not free.<br>
