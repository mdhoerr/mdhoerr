            <dt><font size="-1">Type theory is a study of opposites.
            There are two opposite ways of gathering energy (E and
            I), two ways of perceiving (N and S), two ways of making
            judgments (F and T), and two preferred ways of dealing
            with the outer world (J and P). Neither way is better
            than the other: they are either preferred or not
            preferred, appropriate to a given situation or goal, or
            not appropriate.&nbsp;</font><br>
            <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">It
            appears from </font><a href="http://www3.bc.sympatico.ca/st_simons/arm03.htm"><font size="-1">Rev.
            Hird's article</font></a><font size="-1"> that the
            philosophy from which Jung derived type theory went much
            farther than that. Jung apparently did not believe in the
            Christian idea that good and evil are opposite realities
            that are not merely different aspects of a higher
            reality.&nbsp;</font><br>
            <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Myers-Briggs
            type theory is definitely derived in part from Jung's
            psychology. But it was also partially derived
            independently by Myers and Briggs observing the traits of
            schoolchildren. </font><a href="http://www.braintypes.com/"><font size="-1">Niednagel</font></a><font size="-1">
            also came up with the idea of Brain Types, which also
            uses the Myers-Briggs categories, by observing children
            playing sports. I don't think there is anything
            necessarily contrary to Christianity in applying
            Myers-Briggs type.&nbsp;</font><br>
            <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Might
            one start with the Myers-Briggs type pairs, which are
            opposite but morally neutral, and be led on to the idea
            that good and evil are also opposite but morally neutral?
            Yes. And one might also go on to more Jungian theories
            that are not compatible with Christianity. Certain
            practitioners that follow new age or some eastern
            philosophies may very well see Myers-Briggs type as one
            aspect of their moral relativism.&nbsp;</font><br>
            <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">It
            may be that Christian counselors need to be very careful
            in their use of Myers-Briggs type, especially since I
            think we live in relativistic culture, at least in the
            United States. But I think it can also fit it with the
            Christian idea that every individual is given unique
            gifts by God that are different but equally valid. The
            title of "Gifts Differing" comes directly from a Bible
            quote of Paul, explaining that everyone's gifts were to
            be respected.</font><br>

            interested in unicorns lately. We have been watching the
            video The Last Unicorn (A Rankin/Bass Production in
            association with ITC Films, screenplay by Peter S.
            Beagle, based on his novel). It got me to thinking that
            unicorns could be a good symbol of the ISFJ

         <p><font size="-1">It is rare to find a book on type that
         appears to be written from the perspective of the S
         preference. <i>Your Key to Sports Success</i>, by Jonathon
         P. Niednagel, is such a book. Although he never identifies
         his type, except for the T preference, in the book, the book
         seems clearly targeted toward the S
         preference.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Page
         after page of the book is filled with information on how the
         playing styles of various athletes reflect and is influenced
         by their type. And there is a clear and practical point to
         all of this: Niednagel provides specific guidance to
         athletes to help them improve their performance based on
         type. I had trouble with the style of the book, which seemed
         to drown in facts about athletes, except for an interesting
         chapter on brain functioning (which Niednagel considered
         "optional"). Because of this, my first impression was that
         the book was superficial. However, recognizing my own N
         bias, I realized I was connecting "theory" with "important"
         and "facts" with "trivial". After that, I was able to
         appreciate the book on its own terms.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Niednagel
         does not like the term personality type, preferring instead
         to relate the Myers-Briggs types to brain "wiring". Thus, he
         refers to "Brain TypesÂ®", a term he has registered, and
         he calls his web site </font><a href="http://www.braintypes.com/"><font size="-1">The
         Brain TypeÂ® Institute</font></a><font size="-1">. He
         says that the personality of an individual is dependent on
         many other factors besides their Brain TypesÂ®. Here is
         one example he gives: "<i>Baseball's Steve Carlton and Pete
         Rose, both retired, are ISTPs. Steve was widely known in his
         playing days for his laconic style and refused to talk to
         the press; whereas Pete became known for his
         gregariousness.</i>" Another example from tennis: John
         McEnroe and Stefan Edberg are both ISTPs.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">He
         makes an interesting case that the different function pairs
         can be related to different physical skills. Thus, the ST
         excels at fine motor skills, the SF at gross motor skills,
         the NF at "body harmony", and the NT at ... well, nothing
         physical. But we can become great athletes because if an NT
         claims something within her sphere of capability, she'll
         work day and night until she's one of the best. A corollary
         of this is that by watching how someone plays a sport,
         Niednagel claims to be able to tell the person's
         type.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Another
         plus for the book is the one-word descriptions he gives for
         each type. For example, instead of the usual (boring, to me)
         characterization as "inspector", or "fulfilling duty"
         descriptions, he calls the ISTJ an "investigator." And he
         calls the INTP a "logician" rather than an "architect".
         While logician is correct for INTP as far as it goes, I
         think architect is a much better term. It makes me wonder
         whether there are similar "correct as far as it goes" but
         not really fitting terms being used for other types,
         especially in the SJ and SP descriptions, since most type
         descriptions I come across are written by NTs or
         NFs.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         is a good introduction to the usefulness of type for people
         with an S preference - or who just love
         sports!&nbsp;</font><br>

         auxiliary function is iNtuition, which is extroverted.
         External information acts as a trigger to my inner
         organizing. I don't notice my surroundings at all, except as
         a point of departure for current interests. In fact, it
         sometimes seems that the greatest indicator of my iNtuitive
         preference is my lack of Sensing observation. I miss my
         exit, I don't notice the large birthday balloons festooning
         a coworker's office, and so on. Most of the time, when I am
         not forced to interact with the outside world, I am
         organizing my thoughts on some subject. One current interest
         is an attempt to depict to myself the inner and outer worlds
         of each temperament and type. I imagine that an INFP would
         be organizing how she values and feels about
         things.&nbsp;</font><br>

         picture the inner world of my mind as a relational database.
         Data is collected, but only retained when it can be
         logically connected with pieces of data. One connection only
         - name with person, for example - is not good for
         remembering. Multiple connections are
         better.&nbsp;</font><br>

         picture the inner world of an INFP mind as a spider web. As
         in my case, there are many connections, going in many
         directions. But the connections are not defined logically,
         but by "feel", just as one can imagine "feeling" and
         "pulling on" spider web strands of different lengths and
         thicknesses.&nbsp;</font><br>

         both cases, the N preference implies multiple connections
         among many pieces of information. The dominant T preference
         implies logically defined connections, manipulated by
         changing formulae. The dominant F preference implies
         elastic, "felt" connections which are "moved" and "pulled"

         review: </font><a href="teaching.html#ADD"><font size="-1">Net

         </b></font><font size="-1">but I think you've misunderstood
         my thoughts on the subject. I don't think Attention Deficity
         Disorder (ADD) is an "N" thing, nor do I think N's are more
         creative in general than the SPs (I do think they're more
         creative than the SJs, though). I think of creativity as
         more of a "P" thing. Actually, I tend to think of ISFPs as
         ultimately being the most creative in an artistic sense. But
         the SPs rarely get on the internet, and that's why they
         don't show up on my site.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         do think that SPs are more likely to have the standard
         hyperactive/problem behavior in school, but that they are
         also more likely to find occupations which meet their
         experiential needs. NPs are more likely to do OK
         academically, but underachieve and often feel "different",
         spacey and sometimes pretty hyper (ENFP, ENTP). As adults,
         it seems that NPs may have more problems finding a job they
         are happy with for more than a year or two, partly because
         most jobs are very concrete and NPs aren't. I do suspect
         that a <b>proportionately </b>higher percentage of
         <b>adults</b> going in for ADD diagnosis are NPs. And I
         disagree with Keirsey in his belief that ADD is strictly an
         SP thing; I think it probably used to be, but since Keirsey
         wrote "Please Understand Me" ADD has changed from a focus on
         hyperactivity to a focus on inattention, away from problem
         behavior and towards underachievers. This doesn't mean I
         think it's strictly an NP thing though, either. For one
         thing, there aren't very many NPs compared to
         SPs.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">My
         focus on MBTI is not so much to say that certain types are
         ADDish, but to say that there is no one ADD temperament, and
         to introduce my readers to the concept of temperament
         variation. The ESTP classified as ADD/hyperactive is very
         different from the INFP classified as ADD/inattentive. When
         I read ADD case studies, the various MBTI types tend to jump
         out. For most ADDers, I think the MBTI descriptions more
         often describe them better than the ADD descriptions, and in
         a much more positive, natural way. The only reason I talk a
         lot about INFPs, INTPs, ENFPs and ENTPs is because the vast
         majority of my readers are those temperaments and most
         people want to read about themselves, after
         all.&nbsp;</font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">I have often felt that there was
         something missing in the description of the SJ temperament.
         While it seemed correct, as far as it went, describing the
         SJ goal as "belonging" seemed off to me - as if someone said
         the NT goal was "reading books." Certainly, there has
         probably never been an NT who didn't like to read, but the
         love of reading follows from the "need" to know as much as
         possible and gather competencies or powers. I could also see
         how that could follow from the combination of the N and T
         functions.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">But
         how do you get "needs to belong" from SJ? I think an
         important clue is that all SJ's share introverted sensing as
         the dominant or auxiliary function. In fact, for the rest of
         this article, I'll concentrate just on the two SJ's that
         have introverted sensing as their dominant
         function.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">We
         think of Sensors as realistic, and they are. We especially
         think of SJ's as matter-of-fact, detail oriented, pillars of
         society. So when I read Binnie Ferrand, an ISFJ, in
         </font><a href="http://www.aptcentral.org/bulletin/bulletin-some-observations-of-an-introverted-dominant-sensor.html"><font size="-1">Some
         Observations of an Introverted Dominant
         Sensor,</font></a><font size="-1"> I was surprised to find
         her saying:&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1"><i>Introverted sensation, when
            it is differentiated, is highly tuned and spiritual, not
            being limited to the actual physical sensation. It is
            perhaps the most inarticulate function of all and is best
            expressed in color or form.</i></font></blockquote>
         
         <p><font size="-1">The introverted sensor experiences her
         inner world of concrete facts as "color" or
         "form."&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <p><font size="-1">Then, I read Joe Butt's functional
         analysis of introverted sensing (from </font><a href="http://typelogic.com/istj.html"><font size="-1">ISTJ</font></a><font size="-1">
         ):&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1"><i>A "proper" chair has four
            legs, (and other qualities this poor INTP can only
            guess). Jung viewed introverted sensing as something of
            an oxymoron, in that the natural direction of senses is
            outward toward the object, rather than inward and away
            from it. One has the sense that Introverted Sensors are
            drawn more to the measure of the concept of the perceived
            object than to the experience of that
            perception.</i></font></blockquote>
         
         <p><font size="-1">Not only are the sensory data experienced
         as form, but as "proper" form.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         final piece fell into place when I read John Fudjack's
         description of the "enlightened" quality of Enneagram Type
         One, which he correlates to all the types that end in J.
         Usually called the Perfectionist, he describes the positive
         quality of Enneagram Type One as a </font><a href="http://www.wizvax.net/tap3x/EMBTI/page13.html#ONE"><font size="-1">search
         for perfection and
         completeness</font></a><font size="-1">.&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1"><i>Using Maslow's convention, we
            might distinguish between B-perfection (or B-completion)
            and a degenerate form that we might call 'D-perfection'.
            D-perfection, then, would be the need to be right, in
            perfect order, finished.</i>&nbsp;</font></blockquote>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Could
         the dominant goal of the ISTJ and ISFJ be "perfection" and
         "completeness"? I imagine that the SJ gathers sensory data
         to create a concrete, perfect form. In interacting with the
         world, the SJ continually gathers more sensory data to add
         to the internal "perfect form" and at the same time, maps
         the internal perfect form onto the outer world. The goal is
         to have both the internal form and the outer reality match.
         Since the SJ's forms are based on concrete data, the
         internal and the external can actually be made to
         match.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         would have certain implications. It would make the SJ
         disposed toward keeping things organized and in good order
         (logistics) because the SJ naturally looks at objects in the
         real world and is instantly aware of the difference between
         that object and its ideal state. To see something is to know
         whether and how it needs to be maintained.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         would also explain the satisfaction that the SJ finds in
         doing routine tasks. In such tasks, the inner ideal and the
         outer reality can be made to match regularly. This
         "matching" is a source of pleasure, I imagine, much as the
         discovery of a new logical connection can be for an
         NT.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Finally,
         this would also imply the SJ love of tradition and
         belonging. Through tradition and belonging to social groups,
         the SJ has access to a rich deposit of already developed
         inner forms, painstakingly built up of an immense amount of
         concrete data. Tradition, to an SJ, may be the NT equivalent
         of a library.&nbsp;</font><br>

         <p><font size="-1">Corey, editor of the Epub
         <i>Dissension</i>, (no longer available on the internet as
         of 24 May 2000) has made some Observations. Based on people
         he knows of different types, he concludes that the ISTJ type
         seems to have the most resistence to type theory. Since
         Corey's sample is admittedly small, I wondered whether his
         observation may be applicable to ST types in general,
         especially those who also have a J
         attitude.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         occurred to me because I thought of my own reactions and
         experiences to type. The social norm (most common type
         functions) are ST. As an INTP, then, I shared one function
         (T) with the social norm. On first learning about type, my
         first reaction was that it described me well. But the next
         reaction, occurring at various levels over many years, was
         the flip side of that realization: that there were other
         ways of judging and perceiving that were just as normal and
         valid as mine.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Of
         course, this was no news when I thought of the perceiving
         function. Since S is the norm, I could hardly get through
         life without being aware of the existence and utility of the
         sensing function. However, the judging function was a
         different story.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">As
         a T, I fit the norm, which meant that I had less reason to
         be aware of or value the F function. As a woman, perhaps, I
         was not quite as unaware of it as a man might have been
         (women being more socialized to use F), but I still equated
         F judgement with emotionalism.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">As
         I came to see the validity of F judgement, I found myself
         starting to second-guess my own judgements, now that I was
         aware of a factor that I had been mising. I also found
         myself re-evaluating my opinion of other people's
         judgements.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">For
         an ST, this uncomfortable process of realizing that you have
         been missing something important would happen for both the
         perceiving and the judging preferences.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">That
         may also explain why the NF temperament seems to take to the
         theory so easily. In our ST culture, they are already quite
         aware of S and T. Myers-Briggs goes on to tell them that
         their own preferences of N and F are also

         about what other information I could find on research

         of jobs. I searched on all ISTJ's and got 18 entries (out of
         a database of 230 entries). Of these entries, the three jobs
         that were listed as extremely satisfying, the highest
         rating, were: Counselor, Firefighter, and Process

         among my readers who would like to set me straight? What is

         preferences and not hard - and fast categories. ... correct
         - Feeling types, incorrect - Feelers." </i>It may seem a
         minor difference, but <b>Feeling types</b> describes one
         aspect of a person, Feeler makes it sound like the only
         important aspect of the individual is their Feeling

         the term "strength" implies to me that it is better to have
         a stronger preference than a weak preference. There is less
         of a value judgement implied with "clarity of

         text to abbreviate a preference."</i> I'm sure that this
         guideline is provided in the interest of cutting down on
         jargon and making talk about preferences easier to follow.
         Those of you who've been reading my reviews and features
         know that I tend to use single letters as much or more often
         than writing out preferences. I have a reason I do
         this.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">One
         of my big problems with the terms used by the MBTIÂ®
         inventory to denote the preferences is that they have a lot
         connotations associated with them that are not implied by
         the theory. The I-E dichotomy is probably not so affected by
         this, but Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, Intuiting, Judging and
         Perceiving have strong associations. Although a Thinking
         preference does not imply no feelings, and a Feeling
         preference does not imply inability to think clearly, use of
         the words leads to that unintended bias.&nbsp;</font><br>

          This seems to me to be a step in the right direction, but I

         <p><font size="-1">There are many resources that describe

         Links &gt; Research</font></a><font size="-1"> for past site

         the obvious answer that type doesn't determine everything,
         and that no correlation between type and job satisfaction is
         going to be perfect, I think there are other reasons. As
         Otto Kroeger and Janet Thuesen point out in their book,
         </font><a href="http://www.monumental.com/oka/booksproducts.html"><font size="-1">Type

         too concentrated in certain types is going to have blind
         spots. They use the example of a group of 6 dentists, all
         ISTJ, who went into business together. The business wasn't
         doing well, because, among other things, they weren't making
         people feel good about their practice. So although the ISTJ
         type might seem to be well suited to dentistry, perhaps a
         type with an F preference could make a strong
         contribution.&nbsp;</font><br>

         know. I don't know her type, but she doesn't look much like
         the "typical" accountant. The best way I know to describe
         how she dresses is "artistically". That is, sometimes she's
         in fashion, and sometimes she's conservative, but both
         considerations seem to be rather beside the point. She is
         outgoing and friendly, but not afraid to tell you what she
         thinks. Would you let an accountant like her do your books?
         Well, evidently, to many people her personal style inspires
         trust. People like her, talk to her, and tell her the things
         accountants need to know. And she has more business than she
         can handle, to the point where she gets to pick and choose

         <p><font size="-1">Because most people are sensors, the kind
         of perceiving that intuitives do often gets called
         "imagination." If the imagination leads to practical
         results, it seems like magic. Otherwise, it's just flaky.
         What sensors do is just considered normal, or common
         sense.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">But
         if imagination means to create something that did not exist
         before, it is clear that imagination can be concrete or
         abstract. Using iNtuition, a person may come up with an
         abstract idea called a dragon, described vaguely as a large,
         fire breathing serpent with bat wings. But to bring the
         abstract idea of "dragon" to life requires Sensing, to fill
         in the details. And filling in the details requires
         imagination.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         notice that my 5-year-old daughter, who I suspect prefers
         sensing, does not seem to create any new creatures. But she
         can "play" with a pony, or a dog, or other animal that is
         not really there. And her "playmate" has very detailed
         characteristics. The pony is not just "Rosie", for example,
         but a pony with a certain color mane, tail, bridle, eyes,
         legs, and special markings. And she can draw a detailed
         picture of the pony.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Concrete
         imagination creates an individual concrete example of a
         class that already exists. From object oriented programming,
         our N gives us the class, and our S instantiates it. Our N
         creates the abstract class called "pony", and our S gives us
         an individual pony, with a name and concrete
         characteristics.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Another
         aspect of concrete imagination is the ability to imagine how
         an object will look (or be sensed) under different
         circumstances. Thus, we use sensing to imagine how that
         dress on the rack will look when we put it on, or how the
         addition of a different spice, or more or less of the same
         spice, will affect a recipe we are using. Concrete
         imagination tells an artist how to mix his colors, or a jazz
         player how certain notes will sound in a jam
         session.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         see my daughter do this when she makes things. Sometimes she
         uses building blocks, but she seems to be able take anything
         at hand to create what she has in mind. She does not create
         something new, but uses the materials around her to create
         something she knows. Thus, she made a "computer" out of two
         plastic kiddie chairs, cardboard, and string. She made a
         boat out of a box, with a toy drum stick for a paddle. And
         then, before she went to do something else, she created
         something to keep the paddle from getting lost (when she
         went canoeing, she was told to be sure not to lose the
         paddle) out of wooden blocks and string.&nbsp;</font><br>

         mis-typing many people with a Sensing preference. Can you
         think of other examples of concrete vs abstract imagination?
         Or do you think I'm wrong, or have another perspective? Let

         material in it.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">He
         has re-named the four temperament types to use Plato's
         terms, instead of Greek gods. The SP's are now the Artisans,
         the SJ's the Guardians, the NF's are Idealists, and the NT's
         are Rationals. Each temperament is divided into two roles,
         and then each four-letter type has a descriptive name. As an
         INTP, my temperament is Rational, my role is Engineer, and
         the unique name for my type is Architect. More detailed
         descriptions are available at </font><a href="http://www.keirsey.com/"><font size="-1">Keirsey's
         site</font></a><font size="-1">.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Why
         the emphasis on descriptive terms rather than function
         letters? Keirsey's view of type takes a different
         perspective than Myers and many other type theorists. To
         show the difference in perspective, I will quote Keirsey in
         his new book, p 31:&nbsp;</font></p>
         
         <blockquote><font size="-1">"... personality, like anatomy,
            comes about not by an integration of elements, but by
            differentiation within an already integrated whole,
            emerging gradually as an individuated configuration. I
            claim an organism never becomes integrated because it is
            always integrated. It differentiates by a process of
            evolution into the mature form it is meant to
            become."</font></blockquote>
         
         <p><font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Thus,
         a person is not so much a collection of independent
         functions called INTP as an integrated type called an
         Architect, who, as she matures, will come more and more to
         possess a certain set of characteristics common to her
         type.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">One
         thing I particularly liked about the book was his new
         "matrix of character." Determining type or temperament
         through questionnaires and observation requires trying to
         determine mental viewpoints that are not observable. So
         Keirsey has come up with an extremely simple matrix of two
         easily observable characteristics to help determine
         temperament. People tend to be either concrete or abstract
         in their word usage. And in getting things done (using
         tools) they tend to put the priority either on cooperating
         with others or on the best way to use the tools - they are
         more cooperative or utilitarian. Thus, the SP is a concrete
         utilitarian, the SJ is a concrete cooperator, the NF is an
         abstract cooperator, and the NT is an abstract utiliarian.
         These do seem to me to be the most easily observable set of
         traits I've read about in the literature for a fast take on
         temperament.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Keirsey
         describes each temperament and each individual type in terms
         of many different characteristics. He describes the kind of
         intelligence each temperament develops (Artisan-tactical,
         Guardian-logistical, Idealist-diplomatic,
         Rational-strategic), their interests, self-image and
         values.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">He
         also discusses something I hadn't come across before which
         he calls "orientation" (he doesn't mean the I-E orientation
         here). One's orientation is one's perspective on: the
         present, the future, the past, place and time. Especially
         the categories of place and time were interesting. It will
         come as no surprise that for Artisans the place is "here"
         and the time is "now". But the descriptions for the other
         temperaments, while seeming equally fitting, may bring a
         perspective you hadn't thought of before.&nbsp;</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="1999Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">There
         is a lot of new material in this book. It is not just a
         re-hashing of the first book. Keirsey has many new and
         interesting perspectives on type. If you've read this book,
         I would be interested in getting your </font><a href="chat.html"><font size="-1">feedback</font></a><font size="-1">.
         What did you think of it? I'm always interested in your
         thoughts and opinions.&nbsp;</font></p>
