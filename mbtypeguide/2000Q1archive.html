         <p><font size="-1">I have found the distinction between S
         and N being described as being like that between content and
         context, or like that between data and pattern. Here is how
         I understand that statement: S wants to make the meaning
         most real; N wants to make the reality most
         meaningful.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Everything
         that exists has both pattern and content. For example, a
         tree has both the data that makes it real (size, color,
         bark, roots) and it is also a pattern. The meaning/realtiy
         Tree consists of both the pattern "tree" and the dataset
         [tree]. It is possible to talk as if the two could
         be separated, but I cannot conceive of any case where this
         actually occurs. </font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">For
         S, patterns are used to give meaning to the collection of
         data (Si), or to provide a purpose for the transformation of
         data (Se). Si enjoys collection of data, Se enjoys
         manipulation of data as a realization of meaning. The
         meaning or form inherent in the data can be realized by
         collecting more and more relevant data, like a high
         resolution picture (Si), or by transforming the data to
         conform to its inherent form or meaning. as when
         Michaelangelo "released" the statue of David that he "saw"
         in the block of marble (Se).</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">For
         N, data are used to anchor the application of patterns (Ni)
         or to provide impetus for the creation / recognition of new
         patterns (Ne). Ni enjoys accumulating patterns to give
         meaning to the data, Ne enjoys imagining new patterns to
         give meaning to the data. The reality can be made meaningful
         either by superimposing the greatest number of patterns on
         it, such as when [tree] is seen as a plaything for
         children, a producer of oxygen and an object for poetry
         (Ni), or by creating a new pattern that conforms most
         perfectly to its reality, as when someone came up with
         category/pattern of "mammals" to describe the common data
         shared by a wide range of data (Ne).</font></p>

         verbalizes a desire for an object or goal in life, he
         would'nt know how to go about using "energy" to "manifest"
         or"visualize" having the object (because those methods use a
         6th sense, and "S's" usually only use the 5 senses.) If he
         can't touch, see or hear it, it doesn't exist. Whereas I
         fully utilize manifestation and visualization methods to

         <p><font size="-1">Michael Finley's article, in which he
         named "The Myth of Personality Type" as one of the
         </font><a href="http://www.mfinley.com/articles/team-myths.htm"><font size="-1">Four
         Myths about Teams</font></a><font size="-1"> [Link
         review: </font><a href="type.html#top"><font size="-1">This
         Week</font></a><font size="-1">] got me to thinking
         about the use of type in teams. He is not convinced that
         [MBTI® instrument] "<i>personality reliably and
         consistently reveals itself in outside behaviors ... There
         are too many confounding life experiences which modify what
         we are into how we behave.</i>" Before I continue, I would
         like to remind my readers that while I consider myself
         reasonably well-read on the subject of Myers-Briggs™
         type, I am not certified to administer the MBTI®
         instrument.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">In
         my reading, I have come across two factors that make me
         think that people are less likely to arrive at their "true
         type" when they take the MBTI® instrument in a business
         setting. One factor is that people will often answer the
         MBTI® instrument according to how they act at work,
         which may not reflect their true type, or according to how
         they think their company wants them to answer. The second is
         that it can take considerable time and reflection before a
         person finally ends up with their true type, time which may
         not be available in a business setting.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">If
         this is true for determining one's own type, the factors may
         be magnified when it comes to trying to determine the type
         of others. Type practitioners themselves develop an
         awareness of type pattern that only comes after long
         practice and experience, and even then are careful not to
         impose their own ideas of a person's type onto that
         person.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">What
         does this mean for using type in a business setting? Perhaps
         rather than typing the team members, it would be more useful
         to use functions and temperament. A knowledge of temperament
         can help leaders understand better how to motivate and
         reward team members. It is much easier to determine, through
         trial and error if nothing else, what a team member's
         temperament might be. Most important is realizing how the
         same reward can be perceived very differently by different
         people. For example, the NT "reward" of a new and
         interesting problem to solve can seem like a punishment to
         another temperament. </font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Knowledge
         of functions could be used in two areas: Firstly, as a means
         of identifying and adapting to different communication
         style. Secondly, it can be used as a means of identifying
         blind spots. </font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">In
         the first case, it is not necessary to make any assumptions
         about another person's type. A person can and often does use
         different function "dialects" for a number of reasons. All
         that is necessary is to decide how they are communicating,
         and try to match that style. Dick Thompson talks about The
         Communication Wheel (tm) [My link review at
         </font><a href="companies.html#HPS"><font size="-1">Net
         Links &gt; companies High Performing
         Systems</font></a><font size="-1">]. Personally, I don't
         get into the detail of the different "dialects" according to
         which function is dominant and which is auxiliary. It is
         enough for my use to identify explicitly to myself when
         someone is speaking factually, and make myself focus on the
         facts (S-talk) or abstractly, in which case I would focus on
         the big picture (N-talk), with similar adjustments for other
         functions. </font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">In
         the second case, identifying blind spots, it is also not
         strictly necessary to identify the types of the team
         members. Isabel Myers has formulated a model of decision
         making that incorporates all functions in making a decision.
         First use S to determine the facts, then N to brainstorm
         possibilities, T to analyze cause and effect, and finally F
         to determine how the solutions fit in with corporate values
         and how they will affect people. It may well be that in the
         process of going through this process, a team may discover
         one or more area that causes difficulty. This would be an
         indication that the team has discovered a blind
         spot.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">I
         believe a knowledge of individual team member's type could
         also help considerably in these areas, but since it may be
         difficult to determine this in the course of a business team
         building exercise (or even in the course of several years),
         it may be more practical to focus on the important
         contributions of each function preference, and on the
         different motivations implied by the four
         temperaments.</font></p>

         <p><font size="-1">Type literature seems to be of two minds
         on the developmental hierarchy for Jung's mental functions.
         One of the causes of this discrepancy is that Jung went on
         to explore entirely new themes and interests sometime after
         writing Psychological Types. In some respect, his theory was
         an unfinished symphony. Isabel Myers was one of the more
         prominent students of Jung's writing who attempted to finish
         the piece.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">People
         like Myers and contemporary Jungian theorist John Beebe
         posit a tapestry of dynamic balance among the judging and
         perceiving functions in the introverted and extraverted
         attitudes. Thus the dominant and auxiliary functions are in
         opposite attitudes as are the third (tertiary) and fourth
         (inferior) mental functions. The judging and perceiving
         functions are also aligned in opposite attitudes. So if the
         dominant is judging, then the auxiliary is perceiving, and
         then the tertiary (third) is the other judging function.
         Likewise the fourth function in the hierarchy is the other
         perceiving function. I visualize this as a zigzag pattern in
         a two column, four celled table with extraversion and
         introversion the labels at the top of the
         column.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Beebe
         actually extends this four level hierarchy to eight by
         differentiating the mental functions by their attitude. So
         there are two forms of Intuition (extraverted and
         introverted), two forms of Feeling (extraverted and
         introverted), and so on. The lower case letters attached to
         the function symbol indicates these distinctions. Ne stands
         of extraverted Intuition, Ni stands for its introverted
         form. The eight mental function hierarchy continues the same
         pattern of zigzag, in/out juxtaposition of opposites laid
         out for the first four mental functions. People following
         this particular model of type development find it both a
         reasonable extension of Jung's model and helpful to identify
         with more precision what might be the developmental
         challenges encountered as adults mature. In this model the
         most inferior mental function is that which is both the
         opposite pole of the S/N or T/F dichotomy and in the same
         attitude. Thus the true inferior or opposite of dominant
         introverted Intuition is introverted
         Sensing.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Other
         Jungian scholars and students sometimes offer a contrary
         viewpoint to the above model. They have found passages in
         Psychological Types suggesting that Jung believed that the
         auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions all resided in
         the attitude opposite that of the dominant. Those who
         disagree with this interpretation acknowledge that indeed
         Jung made such statements, but they argue, this is but one
         of many seemingly contradictory elements in Jung's piece.
         And since he left this territory to explore other worlds, we
         don't have volumes of subsequent writings to examine for
         further clarity on this point.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Perhaps
         Jung formulated this idea of the dominant being alone in
         its' attitude through observation of cases of apparent
         development of extraverted forms of the auxiliary, tertiary,
         and inferior functions. Rather than attribute this to the
         effect of environment or nurture, he may have modified his
         evolving model to posit a "nature"
         explanation.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">As
         a model I prefer the symmetry of the dynamically balanced
         in/out, yin/yang pattern found in Myers' and Beebe's
         writings. I think this harmonizes well with the primary
         themes of Jung's work. It sits on my mind in a more
         comprehendible, orderly and comfortable way than the other
         one. Furthermore, the idea of keeping the dominant alone in
         its attitude presents additional challenges when attempting
         to extend the model to the eight mental function pattern
         that is being used in most discussions of type dynamics. It
         would steep us in further complexity and thus become less
         useful. </font></p>

         <b><i>Prayer and Temperament: Different Prayer Forms for
         Different Personality Type</i></b>, by Chester P. Michael
         and Marie C. Norrisey, is the result of the 1982 Prayer and
         Temperament research project involving 457 people. The
         authors identify several prayer styles that have
         traditionally been used in Catholic prayer, and relate them
         to different temperaments. They then give suggestions for
         different temperaments and types.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         idea is to find the form of prayer that comes easiest to
         your type or temperament, and make that your usual prayer
         type. However, the authors recommend becoming acquainted
         with all the prayer forms - they believe that the prayer
         form that is most difficult for you, if practiced when you
         have the time and energy to devote to it, may actually
         provide some of your richest prayer experiences, since it
         draws on your shadow function. However, it would be too
         difficult to use your most difficult prayer form as your
         most common form - they believe you would get discouraged
         and neglect your prayer life.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">Because
         in recent centuries, Catholic seminaries have stressed the
         NT or Thomistic prayer form for priests, brothers, and
         sisters, there is something of a reaction against this
         prayer form. It focuses on a logical and intellectual
         understanding of scripture and religious themes, leading to
         a better understanding of God as Truth. This would be my
         favored prayer form. Although it may be stressed in
         seminaries, I have virtually never run across this form
         among the laity. In fact, my most common experience is to be
         told I'm not really praying - just
         studying.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         SJ or Ignatian prayer form involves trying to recreate in
         vivid detail a scene from the Bible or other useful
         religious text, and place yourself in that scene. This type
         of prayer attempts to make real the SJ's perception of God
         in the history of salvation. According to the book, this is
         my most difficult prayer form, which I should practice
         perhaps once a week. It is most likely to provide my most
         transcendent experiences. I've never actually tried it. Just
         reading the description made me tired.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         SP or Franciscan prayer form tends to concentrate on the
         prayer of good works, and openness to the presence of the
         Holy Spirit. Interestingly, the authors suggest that both
         St. Francis of Assisi, and St. Peter the Apostle were ESFPs.
         This concentrates on God as Beauty or Joy.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">The
         NF or Augustinian prayer form uses bible or religious text
         to find a personal meaning for the texts. This form
         concentrates on God as Love. The authors believe that most
         canonized saints (just means those the Catholic Church is
         convinced are saints) are of this
         temperament.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"> <img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">This
         is an incredibly detailed book, providing prayer suggestions
         not only by temperament but by individual type. They relate
         the historic use of prayer forms, as well as how the
         different temperaments relate to various parts of the Mass
         and other Catholic religious practices. There's a lot more
         there than my short descriptions show. </font></p>

         <font size="-1">Prayer is important to me_ after all, I'm a
         priest! I naturally identify with the symbolism of
         liturgical prayer. Usually I can find space to pray deeply
         in public services. However, private prayer is essential for
         me and I appreciate quietness. Reflection upon scripture
         helps; words can be very evocative and as my preferences
         suggest, I can find connections with my own feelings and
         experiences. I have rosaries, but the tactile and visual
         aids to prayer are not my first concern.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         External information acts as a trigger to my inner
         organizing. I don't notice my surroundings at all, except as
         a point of departure for current interests. In fact, it
         sometimes seems that the greatest indicator of my iNtuitive
         preference is my lack of Sensing observation. I miss my
         exit, I don't notice the large birthday balloons festooning
         a coworker's office, and so on. Most of the time, when I am
         not forced to interact with the outside world, I am
         organizing my thoughts on some subject. One current interest
         is an attempt to depict to myself the inner and outer worlds
         of each temperament and type. I imagine that an INFP would
         be organizing how she values and feels about
         things.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         thicknesses.</i> Believe it or not, I have been
         conceptualizing the workings of my mind as a "web" for a few
         years now! Sometimes, I have used the term "mandala" to
         conceptualize the way I think my mind works, but it's the
         same focus: an interconnecting and holistic way of
         describing my mind. I have all this data, but it is not
         necessarily prioritized when I take it in. It is put into
         the "mindweb" and I intuitively make connections as I
         research or ponder.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         the connections are elastic, but the word "felt" implies
         emotion, and it seems to me to be intuition, rather. Yes, I
         "feel" along the weblines, but this is the same sort of
         "feel" that one has when one is adjusting to data. For
         example, when someone is riding a bicycle, they can "feel"
         whether they are balanced and can adjust, based on that
         feeling.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         say that this is true of me, as well; however, my
         connections may have fuzzier edges...it is not so necessary
         that what I am working on follow a *previously determined*
         logical pattern, particularly if I'm working on an anomaly
         in a pattern. In that case, trying to fit the anomaly into a
         previously determined principle or theory may keep me from
         discovering what the true nature of the anomaly is. However,
         this may be more of an example of Introverted Intuition,

         Since finding the Travel Types site, I got to thinking about
         my own travel experience, and how it relates to my type. My
         all time favorite vacation was when I spent a few weeks in
         Germany with a Eurail pass and youth hostel information. I
         was by myself, and had no schedule for the entire time. I
         had two goals - I wanted to see an outdoor rock concert in
         Germany, and I wanted to visit the hometown of a German
         comedian called Otto - a small town in the north of Germany
         in a province called Eastern Friesland. I achieved both my
         goals.</font><br>
         <font size="-1"><img src="2000Q1archive_files/5space.html" x-claris-useimageheight="" align="bottom" border="0" height="5" width="25">My
         normal routine during the weeks on my own was to get to a
         Youth Hostel by mid afternoon and check in. Then I would
         wander around wherever I was. At supper at the hostel, or
         afterwards in the common room, I&nbsp;would hook up with
         whoever happened to be there, and do whatever they were
         doing that evening, or the next morning. I ended up visiting
         a castle in one town, and a famous church organ in Ulm that
         way. Then, I would go to the train station, see what trains
         were leaving in the next half hour or so, and go wherever
         seemed interesting.</font><br>

         improvement). </font></p>

         <b><i>What Type Am I?</i></b>, by Renee Baron, is a good
         introduction to type. First, the functions are described,
         and you answer several of the usual kinds of questions for
         each function pair to get a preliminary idea of your type.
         The chapter for each function pair also includes a section
         on how to get along with persons with a particular
         preference, and suggestions for people who have a particular
         preference: ie, "How to get along with Sensors" and
         "Suggestions for iNtuitives". After the functions, there are
         sixteen short type descriptions.</font>&lt;&nbsp;<br>

         next chapters introduce the four temperaments. She calls the
         SJs Duty Seekers, the SPs Action Seekers, The NTs Knowledge
         Seekers, and the NFs Ideal Seekers. Each temperament chapter
         also includes a detailed section for each of the four types
         that share that temperament. The section covers work,

         <font size="-2">Occasionally, I read about people who are
         confused about whether they are J or P. Although a common
         indication of J is neatness and to-do lists, while Ps tend
         to look less organized, that's not what J and P are really
         about. The J or P identifies which function tends to be used

         who is J prefers to use her judging function, that is, the T

         everyone has a preferred judging function, either as their

         or vice versa, it may just be that you are developing your
         second function more, which is focussed in the other
         direction. An extraverted J may seem more open as he
         develops his auxiliary N or S function; an extraverted P may
         look to be putting more order to her life as she develops
         her auxiliary T or F.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

         intravert is in an interesting situation. Her dominant
         function is focussed inward. An intraverted P seems less
         organized to the world, because she shows her perceiving
         function to the outside. However, inwardly she prefers a
         judging function, and thus may experience herself as
         extremely organized. </font></p>

         <font size="-2">Inspired by Dr. Lachman's book, "Dogs on the
         Couch", I trying to recall my relationship with pets. I've
         only had one - when I was growing up. He was a
         toy&nbsp;French poodle I named Jaques, because that was the
         only French I knew at the time, from "Frere Jacques". Dr.
         Lachman suggests that poodles might be suited to the
         hardworking SJ type. I remember him jumping and barking
         whenever anyone came to the door. He never bit, and I don't
         remember him ever growling until I came back from college
         years ago to find him old and arthritic.

         he was "my" dog, my mom basically housebroke him and all I
         had to do was remember to feed him once a day.
         Occassionally, I would have to give him a bath, but Mom must
         have filled in a lot, because I didn't bathe him on anything
         near a regular basis. We used to say he was perfectly safe
         around children, and the younger the child, the gentler he
         was. He was never taken for walks (that I remember) by
         anyone, and certainly not by me. He was let loose in our
         large edge-of-a-small-town yard pretty much whenever he
         wanted, and never seemed to go further than a yard or two in
         any direction.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

         clearest memories of him are holding him on my lap and
         petting him while watching TV. The perfect low-maintenance,

         type is INTP - Dr. Lachman suggests that NT types might get
         along well with dogs that need firmer boundary setting.
         However, setting boundaries for dogs sounds like way too
         much work for me. What I need is a low energy, low dominance
         dog that I can pet from time to time without spending too
         much time taking care of it. Actually, sounds like any dog
         would do, as long as someone else did the
         work.</font><font size="-1"> </font></p>

         </font><font size="-2">I prefer playful, mischievous
         parakeets over dogs, and also prefer cats to dogs. I had a
         cat once which I think was an ENFP cat (or it may have been
         an ENTP). Strangely enough, I took the cat personality test
         and discovered that if I were a cat, I'd be an ENTP cat
         (with a low T, so almost an ENFP cat). I also just took an
         online "what breed of dog would you be" test, and discovered
         that if I were a dog, I'd be a Bernese Mountain Dog.
         Allegedly the stereotype you're looking for is that I'm
         supposed to want to own a pit bull since I'm an INTJ. Well,
         in real life I wouldn't want a pit bull, but I did used to
         pretend I had a pit bull for online computer role-playing
         purposes. :-)</font></p>

         </font><font size="-2">We all know that the most common
         preferences for Information Technology workers are I and T,
         right? Well, <b><i>Winning Resumes for Computer
         Personnel</i></b> by Anne Hart reminds us that there is more
         to computer work than code and machines. She opens up the
         field to a full range of careers including coding and
         hardware, of course, but also graphic design, human
         resources, technical writing, and
         more.</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>

         uses type to help you determine what kinds of jobs you might
         prefer, and what your strong points are likely to be. Her
         description of each preference uses example related to the
         job search, or the job environment. Thus, in her description
         of extroversion, she recommends considering a job where
         there is "<i>extensive contact with clients because people
         contact energizes you and being alone drains you.</i>"
         Someone with the S preference will probably "<i>want to see
         ideas applied to real solutions</i>" while if you prefer N,
         you can probably "<i>find a thousand ways to market a
         product or service, or a hundred businesses that utilize one

         the descriptions of each preference, and the short profiles
         of each type aren't enough to help you determine your type,
         there is also a Computer Career Preference Classifier, with
         74 multiple choice questions. Based on Myers-Briggs™
         concepts (but <b>not</b> the official MBTI® instrument),
         this classifier differs from the MBTI® instrument and
         other Myers-Briggs™ based sorters because every
         question relates directly to a job or computer industry
         related situation. For example, if you had a choice between
         two workshops offered by your employer, would you rather
         attend the one on how to repair your personal computer, or
         the one on how to write novels about the future of
         computers?</font><font size="-1">&nbsp;<br>
