         <font size="-1">My 5-year-old daughter, who I think prefers
         F, has been going through an interesting phase lately. She
         will present me with two items, and then ask me to choose
         which is the most important, or the best. For example, she
         will ask: "If there is a fire, what is more important to
         save, me or [favorite toy]." She asks as if it were
         a quiz, and when I give the right answer, she says
         "correct", and repeats what is more important.</font><br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">She
         also maintains a hierarchy of people she loves: first Jesus,
         then Mommy, then Daddy. We had some discussions over whether
         she should love Mommy and Daddy best, or the
         angels.</font><br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">I
         told her it was okay for little girls to love Mommy more
         than Jesus, but it doesn't seem to trouble her at all.
         She'll quiz me on whether I love her best or Jesus best, and
         she wants me to answer correctly - Jesus.</font><br>

         conscious ranking of relationships, and the relative
         importance of people and things is unexpected. I expected my
         daughter to ask lots of "why" questions, but not lots of
         value ranking questions. In fact, in the parenting books
         I've read, I haven't seen any reference to kinds of
         questions /quizzes my daughter asks.</font><br>

         wonder if this is a common phase that children with the F
         preference go through. Is it "invisible" just because most
         mothers prefer F (since two-thirds of women prefer F
         according to some statistics) and don't notice
         it?</font>&nbsp;<br>

         with Authority</i></b></font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><i>by Mary Hoerr, December 1,
         1999</i></font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1">In surfing and reading various books, I am
         struck by how often the lowest or lower level of
         development, whether psychological or spiritual, sounds like
         a caricature of the SJ values of authority and tradition.
         The higher levels look more NF or sometimes
         NT.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">The
         lower levels are characterized by "black and white"
         thinking, unquestioning adherence to authority, adopting the
         values of parents uncritically. Development involves either
         reaching within for one's own personal values and relating
         them to the real world (NF version) or critically analyzing
         rules and the claims of authority (NT
         version).</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">While
         I agree that unquestioning adherence to authority is a lower
         level of development, I disagree that the development
         process is the same for all temperaments. Probably all NT
         types, and at least the NFP types, have an inherent distrust
         of authority. Therefore, any development process that is
         overly critical or that leads too far from authority may
         reflect more upon an typological blind spot than true
         development.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">I
         would guess that the development path for an SJ involves
         learning to adequately judge which authority to follow. For
         the STJ, this may involve objectively analyzing whether the
         rule system is reasonable and consistent. For an SFJ, it may
         mean looking at the values expressed in the actions of the
         authority figure. In either case, the purpose is to
         adequately judge the authority figure or structure so that
         it may be followed until further analysis becomes
         necessary.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">At
         some point the SJ, as all the other temperaments, will need
         to face the limitations of their preferences. Because no one
         has perfect knowledge, it is possible for different people
         to follow different authorities without being evil. Similar
         roadblocks are met by NT's, who must face that it possible
         for equally intelligent people to come to equally logical
         but different conclusions.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">Ideally,
         the NT learns to accept the limitations of logic, leading to
         more tolerance of others and some skills in other methods,
         although she will never abandon it as her primary way of
         making sense of the world. In the same way, when the SJ
         accepts the limitations of authority, he does not reject
         this primary way of relating to the world, but adds a wider
         acceptance of others and other methods to his world
         view.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         <font size="-1"><b>INTP</b></font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1">Minimal. For me rules and regulations are
         tools the existence of which is justified only by right
         ends. For me moral decisions should always be made
         independent of authority. If authority serves morally
         acceptable and logically coherent ends, good. If not, it has
         no relevance and should be changed. "I just followed the
         orders/law/international regulations" is not good enough for

         that he is so solid and dependable yet so warm and full of

         not by coincidence, he works for a landscaping company and

         trees. We have two very large and healthy ficus trees in our
         house that he is very attached too. We have had several
         discussions over the ficus trees where he advocates giving

         I come out as an ENTP instead of an INTP. I don't like chess
         since my younger sister beat me at it when we both were in
         grade school. But it got me to thinking about the games I
         *do* like.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">I
         like solitaire and scrabble. I like soccer (or at least I
         used to when I could still play). Still thinking - I can't
         think of any other games I like to play. Perhaps guessing
         games? I used to like Trivial Pursuit, although I never
         liked the questions about actors and actresses or
         sports.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">I
         don't like rubik's cube or other puzzles. I do like puzzle
         books though, especially diagramless puzzles and
         cryptograms.</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">Type
         theory does imply certain types will like certain kinds of
         games or sports. An INTP is supposed to like chess. An ESTP
         would like poker. It makes sense to me, but I don't match
         up. What about you?</font>&nbsp;<br>

         </i></b>by Paul D. Tieger &amp; Barbara Barron-Tieger is not
         just another list of jobs sorted by type. It provides
         interesting and useful job search information and
         recommendations for each type.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" nosave="" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">Very
         useful is the list of ten items that tend to spell career
         satisfaction for each type. For example, an INFP prefers a
         job that "<i>allows me to express my vision through my
         work</i>", has "<i>a minimum or rules or regulations,
         letting me work on projects when I feel inspired</i>", but
         "<i>does not require me to present my work frequently in
         front of groups</i>". On the other hand, an ESTJ prefers a
         job that "<i>is realistic and tangible in nature and has
         practical applications and concrete results</i>", is
         "<i>measured and evaluated by fair, logical, explicit, and
         objective standards</i>" but which "<i>is done in a friendly
         environment with other hardworking and conscientious people
         who do not bring their personal problems to work or expect
         me to share my personal feelings on the
         job</i>".&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">The
         "Implications for the Job Search" section tailors job search
         strategies to each type. For example, the INFP might try to
         look beyond what is known to imagine jobs that she might
         like, express herself in writing whenever possible, and use
         limited, targeting networking starting with close friends.
         An approach suited the strengths of an ESTJ, on the other
         hand, may include developing a list of important job
         characteristics such as salary, benefits, etc.; presenting
         himself as capable, stable and competent; and networking
         extensively.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <img src="1999Q4archive_files/5space.html" alt="indent" align="bottom" height="5" hspace="10" width="5"><font size="-1">The
         beginning chapters provide a variety of ways to describe
         preferences to help you determine your type, without using
         multiple choice questionnaires. They include the usual
         contrasting lists of descriptions for each preference, but
         also include many good concrete examples. For example, in
         illustrating the N-S preferences, they describe how the S
         and the N each perceive the speeding car in a car accident.
         The S notes that the car was going at least fifty miles an
         hour. The N recalls wondering where the car was going in
         such a hurry.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         people often "<i>engage their inferior and tertiary
         functions for rest, relaxation, and recreation.</i>" She
         also says that "<i>People whose daily work requires them to
         use less preferred functions may use their preferred
         processes in their leisure time.</i>" She puts people with
         dominant F, whether introverted or extraverted, in that
         category (ISFP, INFP, ESFJ, ENFJ). Based on that, I've added
         some additional gift suggestions of my own.</font>&nbsp;<br>

         <font size="-1">I regularly check the terms my visitors
         search on. Recently, there was a search on "cultural effects
         on personality", which returned no hits. That, combined with
         an email request for MBTI® instrument info in Spanish,
         led me to start a search for cross-cultural MB information
         on the web. You can see the results in three new link

         have read people who think that the type distribution of
         United States citizens may be expected to be different than
         other cultures, because most of us were voluntary immigrants
         who chose to leave their homelands behind. This could imply
         a country more slanted toward NP than perhaps the global
         average.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         true, one might expect that the Native American and slave
         descendant populations in the United States would show a
         different distribution, since neither voluntarily left their
         homelands. In the case of one limited study of the Navajo
         population, (see link above) there were significant
         differences.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         <font size="-1"><b><i>Beside Ourselves: Our Hidden
         Personality in Everyday Life</i></b>, by Naomi L. Quenk is
         not a book for someone who is brand new to type theory, but
         don't feel you need to be an expert either. It explores how
         the fourth or "shadow" function works in our lives,
         especially when we're under stress. When I read this book,
         it was like discovering type all over
         again.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         of the most eye-opening parts of the book to me was a
         description of each preference both in its developed form
         and in its primitive form. Thus, as an INTP with dominant
         Ti, my shadow is Fe. Characteristics of developed Fe, such
         as is more likely with an ENFJ and ESFJ, are described in
         the book as:&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         like:&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         showed me two things: First of all, it describes what I can
         look for as I develop my Fe further. Secondly, it helps me
         not to project the characteristics of my less developed Fe
         onto people who have a natural primary or secondary
         preference for Fe.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>

         further, it has helped me to better understand the
