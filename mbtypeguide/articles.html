         the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives'
         (CHIME) May 1998 seminar on IT management. One speaker
         suggested that IS staff members - typically introverts who
         are not good at dealing with conflict - may benefit from
         conflict resolution training. He suggested using
         Myers-Briggs™ type, while another speaker had a simpler
         scheme that divided people into four types: analytical,
         amiable, driver and expressive. </font></p>

         <font size="-1">This article provides interesting insights
         into a new chief of police, called in to make the police
         department more responsive to the citizenry. New Minneapolis
         Police Chief Robert Olson started out by letting his inner
         circle of deputy chiefs and administrators know his
         personality type - ENTP. The article describes how different
         people - in the department, in the city - react to him, and
         relates it to his type, from time to time. For example,
         about three months into the job, "<i>his inner circle bought
         him a wristwatch - something he's never
         worn.</i>"</font></p>
