         I'm going to study them and make sure I follow their

         <i>"One must always express terms in such a way as to convey
         the concept of preferences and not hard - and fast
         categories. ... correct - Feeling types, incorrect -
         Feelers." </i>It may seem a minor difference, but <b>Feeling
         types</b> describes one aspect of a person, Feeler makes it

         <font size="-1">January 4, 1999, I reviewed </font><a href="books.html"><font size="-1"><i>Please
         Understand Me II</i></font></a><font size="-1">, which
         associated Tactical intelligence as the forte of SP's,
         strategic for NT's, diplomatic for NF's and logistical for
         SJ's. Then this week, I came across a company that relates
         that idea to a practical situation. In <b>Maslow's
         Hierarchy: A Fresh View of I/S Training's Customer
         Relationships</b>, Chester Delaney describes how the I/S
         professional's relationship with customers must move from
         tactical (Fix it now!) to strategic to diplomatic. And here
         is Delaney's view of theory, from his first issue of the
         bi-monthly essay letter of the <b>ITG Trainers Forum</b>,
         (part of ITG):&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1"><i>...theory provides the foundation upon
         which action rests. It is an efficiency tool, furnishing a
         framework for making decisions and setting priorities. It
         shapes both behavior and perception (doing this last,
         indeed, to a fault if one is not careful.) Devoting a
         reasonable amount of time to theoretical considerations,
         then, is a very practical thing to
         do.</i>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1">ITG, which stands for Interpersonal
         Technology Group, Inc., uses various tools, including an
         understanding of Myers-Briggs™, in their work. One of

         clinical psychologist with 20 years of</font>&nbsp;<br>
         <font size="-1">experience in the field. The site walks you
         through four pages describing each type pair. Then it brings
         up a short type description. You can go back and forth,
         changing selections, until you get a type description that
         you think fits. Once you have determined your type, you can
         order a two page Career Planning Profile based on your type
         for $14.95, as of 11/11/99. I didn't order one, because I
         usually only check out the free stuff. The Career Planning
         Profiles are produced by the authors of <i>Do What You
